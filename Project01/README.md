Project 1

Cutlery Collection- an exploration of Smithsonian Cutlery data

Pages: https://daiarose.github.io/major-studio-1-daia/Project01/

This project explores the quantative aspects of all cutlery objects within the Smithsonian. It categorizes them by material and type and displays a heatmap of each amount with additional details within each grouping label of the subcategories it contains.

Fungi holotype collections explore what months the collection date for the holotype is in and then details of the breakdown for biogeographical region within that month. The dataset has each specimen with the date and region of collection. There are around 600 individual specimens. It is visualized with a radial histogram to display the monthly data as a calendar year and then detail views are a simple bar with colors separating the regions. An aspiration would be making this look like mushroom gills because I really like incorporating that type of natural imagery and I think it makes it much more recognizable and conveys the topic sooner.

Cutlery materials over time explore the various materials that spoons, forks, knives and other cutlery instruments have been made of over the centuries.The dataset has each object with the name (ex: pocket knife) and the materials present as well at the date it was made. There are around 4900 individual items. It is visualized with a categorical scatterplot with materials along the longer horizontal edge and type along the vertical. There is a slider at the bottom for the time period. Frequency of each combination is represented by dots within the grid with varying saturation- more for more frequent.

Postage stamp popularity explores the ranking of each topic of postage stamp over a stretch of time. It shows how the variations in frequency in relation to each other. The dataset has postage stamp topics and dates. There are around 35,500 individual items. It is visualized with a bump plot to show the rankings over time.
