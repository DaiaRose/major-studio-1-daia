Toward the end of 1915, Curtiss conducted a design study for a large aircraft engine of 224 kW (300 hp) or more. The objective was a power plant for large seaplanes, such as the British Naval Air Forces used in patrolling the North Sea for enemy submarines. The quickest way to develop such an engine was thought to be through enlarging the 8-cylinder Curtiss VX engine into a 12-cylinder version. The first 12-cylinder Curtiss engine was designated V-4.
Although this engine eventually developed about 298 kW (400 hp), it was not produced because a successful rival, the Liberty, was lighter and had the same power. Only one V-4 was made. It powered a hydro-plane speed boat, "Miss Miami," which at one time held a world speed record of 106 km/hr (66 mph).
This M2-F3 lifting body was the first of the heavyweight, wingless lifting body research craft of the 1960s. The lifting body programs tested the concept of achieving aerodynamic lift from just the shape of wingless craft, a concept used in designing the Space Shuttle. This F3 is the F2 re-built after a landing accident seriously damaged the M2-F2. The rocket-powered M2 was launched from beneath a B-52 mother craft at an altitude of 45,000 ft. and would glide to a landing. NASA transferred the M2-F3 to the Museum for display in 1975.

The classic Beechcraft Bonanza was introduced in 1947 and is still built today by Textron Aviation. The four-place aircraft sported all-metal construction and retractable landing gear for the sophisticated or executive pilot. Initially designed with the distinctive butterfly or V tail--a conventional tail model was offered too--it was the basis for later Beech aircraft.
On March 7-8, 1949, William P. Odom set a light-plane, nonstop distance record from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Teterboro, New Jersey, in the Waikiki Beech (see markings on left side), the fourth Bonanza built. Congressman Peter F. Mack flew the renamed Friendship Flame on a goodwill world flight from October 7, 1951 to April 19, 1952 (see markings on right side).

Introduced in 1930, the Northrop Alpha represents a transitional air transport design, a blend of old and new aircraft technology. The Alpha could enclose six passengers in a snug, comfortable cabin, but the pilot remained exposed to the elements. The aircraft was all metal and streamlined, but had fixed landing gear and only one engine.
Designed by John K. "Jack" Northrop, the Alpha was a great step forward in metal aircraft. Many of its features, particularly the multicellular wing design, were later used in the Douglas DC-2 and DC-3. Although more powerful twin-engine aircraft rendered the Alpha obsolete for passenger service, it continued to serve as a fast express cargo plane.
This aircraft was restored by volunteers from Trans World Airlines.
The United States possessed no combat-worthy aircraft upon entry into World War I in 1917. Several European aircraft were considered. The British DH-4 was selected because of its comparatively simple construction and its apparent adaptability to mass production. It was also well-suited to the new American 400-horsepower Liberty V-12 engine. American-built DH-4s were dubbed the "Liberty Plane." By war's end, 13 Army Air Service squadrons, five of them bomber squadrons, were equipped with them. In addition, four combined Navy-Marine squadrons were flying DH-4s along the Belgian coast. Of the 4,346 DH-4s built in the United States, 1,213 were delivered to France, but of those only 696 reached the Zone of Advance. In the postwar period, the DH-4 was the principal aircraft used by the U.S. Government when air mail service began in 1918.
The DH-4 in the NASM collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.
Many people consider the P-51 Mustang the best fighter of World War II. Its combination of speed, range, maneuverability, and firepower gave it great versatility. Its use in all major theaters of the war included long-range high-altitude escort, strafing, and photo reconnaissance.
Originally developed by North American for the British, the Mustang was later ordered in large quantities by the U.S. Army Air Forces. This P-51 is displayed in the markings of the 351st Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group,Eighth Air Force.

The Supermarine Spitfire is a legend in British air history. With the Hawker Hurricane, it successfully defended England against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, and throughout the war it saw service on every major front. Performance and handling were superb. The Mk.VII, the second high-altitude version developed, was used in England and the Middle East. Several Mk 2EXVIs, the last production version to use the Merlin engine, remained in service through 1950. In all, 20,351 Spitfires were built.

This is the AGM-86B, the second version of the U.S. Air Force's air-launched cruise missile (ALCM) and built by Boeing. Launched from B-52 bombers, the missile had a nuclear warhead, a turbofan jet engine, a range of approximately 2,400 km (1,500 miles), and two navigation systems that enabled it to fly close to the ground making it difficult for enemy radars to pick up. First deployed in 1982, some of the missiles began to be converted in 1986 to the AGM-86C with a conventional warhead and a Global Positioning System-aided navigation system. This missile was the second flight model tested and was transferred to NASM by the U.S. Air Force in 1982.
In the early 1930s, the Navy supported Wright development of two new liquid-cooled engines, the XR-2120 (H-2120) and the V-1800. This was part of a "high-speed development program" undertaken by the Navy because of concern over the growing superiority of foreign airplanes in top speed, especially as demonstrated in the 1929 Schneider Trophy contest and again in 1931.
First of the two engines and derived from the Curtiss H-1640, it was anticipated that the XR-2120 design, with liquid cooling and enlarged cylinders, would make a good racing engine. The small diameter of the engine, considered important for drag reduction, proved to be difficult to develop due to excessive angularity of the connecting rods and other problems. The Navy withdrew support from the project, primarily because it decided to focus on the development of air-cooled engines. Convinced that the design was mechanically poor, Wright made little effort to persuade the Navy to change its decision and dropped the project.
The first versions of this engine were built in 1908, and set an 8-hour endurance record in 1910. It continued to be used through World War I, especially in British training planes. A unique feature of the engine was that the propeller was driven at one-half engine speed by being driven off of the camshaft rather than the crankshaft in the conventional manner.
For cooling on tractor planes, a cowl was fitted to the engine to funnel the prop wash through the cylinders. On pusher planes, a fan was mounted opposite the propeller end to force air through a casing which partially surrounded the cylinders. Cooling the cylinders was augmented with fuel cooling.
The engine powered French aircraft including Farman, Voisin, and BE 2, and British aircraft including Airco D.H.6, Alliance P.1, Avro 548, Caudron G. III, Maurice Farman Serie VII Longhorn and Serie 11 Shorthorn, Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5a, and Vickers F.B.7A.
Frenchman Henri Mignet designed the HM.14 Pou du Ciel (Flying Flea) in 1933. He envisioned a simple aircraft that amateurs could build and even teach themselves to fly. In an attempt to render the aircraft stall-proof and safe for amateur pilots to fly, Mignet staggered the two main wings. The HM.14 enjoyed a period of intense popularity in France and England but a series of accidents in 1935-36 permanently blackened the airplane's reputation.
Thise Mignet-Crosley Pou du Ciel is the first HM.14 made and flown in the United States. Edward Nirmaier and two other men built the airplane in November 1935 for Nirmaier's boss, Powel Crosley, Jr. Crosley was president of the Crosley Radio Corporation. He believed that the Flea might become a popular aircraft in the United States. After several flights, a crash at the Miami Air Races in December 1935 grounded the Crosley HM.14 for good. In 1960 Patrick H. "Pat" Packard donated this Pou du Ciel to the Smithsonian. In 1987 Packard and Patti Koppa finished restoring the aircraft. The original ABC Scorpion engine was missing, so these two artisans fabricated a wooden replica.
The Chevrolet Brothers Aircraft Company, owned by Swiss immigrants Arthur and Louis Chevrolet, well known designers of automobile engines and drivers of race cars, designed this in-line, inverted four-cylinder aircraft engine. In advertisements, Louis Chevrolet was quoted as saying "Upside down is right side up." For among the advantages of the design were improved pilot visibility and propeller ground clearance. Designated Model D-4, the engine was certificated in December 1929, and became known as the Chevrolair. A D-4 engine powered Travel Air low-wing aircraft won first place in its class at the September 1930 Cleveland National Air Races.
Subsequently, the Chevrolet Brothers Aircraft Company failed and the engine design sold to the Glenn L. Martin Company of Baltimore, Maryland. Uprated and renamed Martin 333, it was recertificated in July 1930, and powered the Martin 162A Tadpole Clipper and various Driggs aircraft.
During the 1920s William J. Powell led a small group of black air enthusiasts in Los Angeles. He established the Bessie Coleman Flying Club in 1929 and sponsored the first all-black air show on Labor Day 1931. As part of his effort to make aviation accessible to African American students, he taught classes on aeronautics at the Bessie Coleman Flying Club. This drafting pen was among the equipment he used while teaching.
In 1925, Continental, a successful manufacturer of automotive engines, purchased the rights for a Burt-McCollum single-sleeve valve engine design. Believing this technology might replace poppet valves in aircraft engines, Continental announced the R-790 engine in 1927, incorporating single-sleeve valves initially installed on a Wright 9-cylinder engine. It was never fully tested, but followed by the 7-cylinder R-794, for which five engines were ordered by the U.S. Navy in 1934. It was tested, but did not go into production.
The Navy later sponsored a number of unconventional engine designs; however, few entered production. In the case of the 1939 XR-1740-2 development, the outcome was apparently typical of single-sleeve valve history. For example, Bristol’s Roy Fedden, one of history’s great aircraft engine experts, was unable to mass produce single-sleeve engines. Continental only became successful after reverting to poppet valves, and this artifact represents a seemingly simple new concept that could not compete with older, conventional technology better developed for practical application.
This child-sized baseball bat belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. Her maternal grandfather, Anders Anderson, made it to teach her how to swing and hit the ball when she was about seven years old. From a young age, Ride was athletic and passionate about sports. Her sister, Karen "Bear" Ride, believed that Ride's habit of memorizing and analyzing batting averages and pitching statistics bolstered her early interest in mathematics. Ride soon focused her attention on tennis, and as a college student she was a nationally ranked tennis player.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 in the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger accident in 1986 and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987, titled “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space” but known popularly as the "Ride Report."
After she left NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego, where she also served as the director of the California Space Institute. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she founded to promote science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the baseball bat to the Museum in 2013.
This numbered STS-7 Robbins medallion was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. STS-7 was historic for making Ride the first American woman in space. The medallion's design incorporates the shuttle's large robotic "arm" bent in the shape of a seven, signifying the mission number. The starburst below the shuttle uses gender symbols, four male and one female, to create a five-pointed star representing the crew members. The first photograph of a shuttle in orbit was taken during STS-7, and Ride, along with another crew member specially trained to operate the robotic arm, arranged for the arm to be seen in the photograph in the shape of a seven, the same as it appears on the medallion.

Aeronca (Aeronautical Corporation of America) built the first widely accepted light planes in the U.S., the Collegian. These were originally powered by an engine based on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle engine, the Harlequin. To overcome limitations of that engine, Aeronca designed its own engine, the E-107, and that engine proved inadequately powered for a larger aircraft.
Certificated in April 1931, the Aeronca E-113 was an outgrowth of the Wright-Morehouse engine and was designed again for light aircraft. Considered highly reliable, it was the most powerful two-cylinder engine of its time. The E-113 first powered the Aeronca C-1 Cadet aircraft in 1931. It was also used in the Aeronca C-2 and C-3 aircraft. The C-3 was widely used for student instruction in the 1930s.
First flown in 1935, the Douglas DC-3 became the most successful airliner in the formative years of air transportation, and was the first to fly profitably without government subsidy. More than 13,000 DC-3s, both civil and military versions, U.S. and foreign built, were produced. Many are still flying.
An enlarged variant of the popular 14-seat DC-2, the 21-seat DC-3 was comfortable by the standards of its time and very safe, because of its strong, multiple-spar wing and all-metal construction. The airlines liked it because it was reliable, inexpensive to operate, and therefore profitable. Pilots liked its stability, ease of handling, and excellent single-engine performance.
The airplane on display above flew more than 56,700 hours with Eastern Air Lines. Its last commercial flight was on October 12, 1952, when it flew from San Salvador to Miami. It was subsequently presented to the Museum by Eastern’s president, Edward V. Rickenbacker.

To compete for the Schneider Trophy, Doolittle had to learn how to taxi, take off, land, and moor an airplane equipped with floats and had to hold a hydroairplane certificate from the National Aeronautic Association.
The Challenger engine, which followed the water cooled Curtiss V-8 OX-5 engine that powered the World War I JN-4 “Jenny” trainer aircraft, was designed as a lower-cost, medium-power engine specifically intended for small commercial cabin aircraft and open cockpit sport planes. The engine received its original Approved Type Certificate (No. 5) in 1928, which was revised and re-issued in 1930.
The small, compact configuration of two staggered rows of three cylinders was intended to provide better dynamic balance and, thus, smoother operation, as well as low frontal area for improved airframe streamlining and better pilot visibility. However, although being economical, the Challenger did not run smoothly, and was frequently replaced by aircraft owners because of a vibration problem.
The Challenger powered a variety of aircraft types including the Curtiss Robin, Curtiss Fledgling, Curtiss Tanager, Curtiss-Wright Sedan 15-C, Command-Aire Model 5C3, and Eastman Sea Rover E-2.
This device was part of the Crew/Vehicle Disturbance experiment flown aboard the Skylab space station launched by the United States in 1973. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effect of crew activities on the vehicle's stability by measuring the forces, torques, and vehicle motions caused by the astronauts' movements. As an astronaut stood on the unit or moved between units, precise measurements of his motions and resultant forces on the vehicle structure were sent the ground for comparison with vehicle attitude and pointing control data to analyze disturbances. This extra device was stowed aboard the backup Skylab orbital workshop that NASA transferred to the Museum.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
The Wide Angle Camera (WAC) from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a CCD camera equipped with a wide baffle. It can capture broad images in five visible light bands and two ultraviolet light bands. Images from the WAC have been used to produce detailed photomosaic maps of the Moon.
This flight spare instrument is identical to the flown instrument built by Malin Space Science Systems. NASA transferred the camera to the Museum in 2016.
Launched on November 11, 1935, from the Stratobowl near Rapid City, South Dakota, Explorer II carried Captain Albert Stevens, Captain Orvil Anderson, and an assortment of instruments to a world record altitude of 22,066 meters (72,395 feet).
Explorer was the brainchild of Captain Stevens, Chief of the Army Air Corps’ photography laboratory at Wright Field, Ohio. With funding from the National Geographic Society, he and two crew members attempted a world altitude-record flight in 1934 with Explorer I. The flight ended in disaster when the balloon ripped shortly after launch, and its hydrogen mixed with air and exploded. After a harrowing few moments while Stevens had trouble escaping through the manhole, he and his two fellow aeronauts parachuted to safety.
For the next attempt, in Explorer II, the portholes were widened for easier escape, and the balloon was filled with helium. To ensure that it attained a record altitude, the balloon was enlarged, the crew was cut from three to two, and its scientific payload was halved.
Like Explorer I, Explorer II was constructed of welded magnesium/aluminum alloy sections. The 2.8 meter (9 foot) sphere weighed 290 kilograms (640 pounds) and carried a payload of 700 kilograms (1,500 pounds). The balloon lifted off at 7:01 am, reached its maximum height of 22 kilometers at 10:50 am and remained there until 12:20 pm. Then it began its descent and touched down at 3:14 pm near White Lake, South Dakota.
One of the flight’s most dramatic successes was the aerial photography: the first photographs showing the division between the troposphere and the stratosphere and the actual curvature of the earth from the record altitude. Captain Stevens’ cameras captured stunning photographs of South Dakota and surrounding states, and demonstrated the potential of high-altitude, long-range reconnaissance from manned balloons.
Although the scientific experiments were reduced from the original plans, Explorer II carried instruments that collected data for studies in cosmic ray research, the ozone layer, aeronomy, meteorology, biology, and radio propagation in the high atmosphere.
The National Geographic Magazine devoted several articles to the flight, widely disseminating the photographic, scientific, and engineering accomplishments to the general public. The flight was a public relations success for the Army and the National Geographic Society, and was also a successful venture between government, military, and civilian scientific interests.
In 1933, Richard C. du Pont teamed with Hawley Bowlus and the two men set up shop in San Fernando, California, to build gliders. Their most successful competition sailplane was the Senior Albatross. The Bowlus shop built four and Warren Eaton bought the third in May 1934. He named the sailplane "Falcon" and flew it often including over the Blue Ridge Mountains from an airfield at Big Meadows, VA, in 1934. Eaton had served in the U. S. Army Air Service during World War I and flown SPAD XIII fighters (see NASM collection) in the 103rd Aero Squadron, 3rd Pursuit Group, at Issoudon, France, from August 27, 1918, until Armistice Day, November 11. Eaton led the effort to found the Soaring Society of America in 1932 and became the organization's first president.
This a non-regulation Australian style bush hat worn by members of the United States Air Force serving in Thailand during the Vietnam War.
This hat was worn by the donor, who flew four combat missions in Vietnam either piloting or in formation with the Museum's F-105 at the end of 1967 with the 34th Tactical Fighter Squadron.
According to the donor, the “Go to Hell Hat” was a Thai-made Australian Bush hats worn by F-105 pilots and their Electronic Weapon's Officer (EWO) who were stationed in Thailand at Takhli and Korat.
'When a new pilot arrived at Takhli or Korat, he immediately purchased a 'go to hell hat' (an) Australian bush hat at the Post Exchange. For each mission flown against North Vietnam, he etched a black hash mark on the front of the hat; for missions into the Hanoi area (Route Package 6), he penned a red mark on the hat. Status in an F-105 Squadron often boiled down to how many red and black hash marks a pilot wore, with the ultimate status symbol being the 100-missions patch he received at the end of a tour.'
The Liberty's purpose was American mass production of standard units when the U.S. entered World War I. Co-designed in a week in mid-1917 by Jesse Vincent of Packard Motor Car and Elbert Hall of Hall-Scott Motor Car, with a planned series of 4-, 6-, 8-, and 12-cylinder models, this Model L-8 was the first Liberty engine. However, power requirements made it obsolete before entering service, and the twelve-cylinder Liberty was then built.
To ensure workable engines in the shortest time, only proven components were used. The Liberty's success was due entirely to the fact that the best engineers, production experts, and manufacturing facilities were provided to the Government. Leading automotive manufacturers, including Ford, Lincoln, Packard, Marmon, and Buick, built the engines.
The Liberty 12 Model A powered numerous aircraft including the de Havilland DH-4, the Navy-Curtiss NC-4, Fokker T2, Loening Model 23, Douglas World Cruiser, Douglas M-1 Mailplane, and Curtiss H-16 flying boat.
The Arrow Sport A2-60 is a rare example of an alternative design, depression-era biplane. It complements the Smithsonian's Kreider-Reisner Challenger and Waco 9, conventional tandem open-cockpit biplanes. The Arrow Sport offered a side-by-side, dual-control cockpit arrangement. Its cantilever wings were attached only to the upper center section strut and lower fuselage-they had no other struts or external flying wires for bracing. However, enough pilots were uncomfortable without some sort of visible wing support that "N" struts later became standard.
Equipped with 60- or 90-horsepower LeBlond engines, Arrow Sports made excellent trainers. About 100 were built through 1931, then more, at a slower pace, through the 1930s. This airplane had a succession of owners and even spent some time in England.
In 1954 Piper Aircraft Corporation introduced the four-place, retractable gear Apache, developed from the Twin Stinson and the first of the Piper "Indian" executive and business lines that continue to this day. Over 2,000 all-metal Apaches, a departure from the classic tube and fabric Cub and, at $32,000, the least expensive light twin, were built before being upgraded in 1960 to the popular Aztec series.
William Davenport bought serial number 14 (unlucky #13 off the line) for Davenport Airlines service between Richmond and Hampton Roads, Virginia. As Aviation Specialists, Inc., Davenport and his Apache offered charter flights and multi-engine instruction, logging more than one million miles. It was believed to be the oldest flying Apache when Davenport flew it to Dulles Airport in 1990.
This is a wooden scale model (1:20) of the Astro-1 observatory designed to fly on Space Shuttle in 1986; the observatory included a Field Camera to observe Comet Halley. The three major instruments on Astro-1 included the Hopkins UV Telescope (HUT), the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and the Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter Experiment. The Challenger accident led to a four-year delay and removal of the Field Camera because the Comet Halley was no longer in sight. After shuttle flights were resumed, the observatory was installed on the orbiter Columbia with an x-ray telescope in place of the comet imager. On its nine-day flight from December 2 to 11, 1990 the observatory functioned smoothly and made numerous astronomical observations. The full-scale flown HUT (Catalogue # 20010307000) and the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope from Goddard Space Flight Center are also in the collection.
The Nakajima Ha 105 began development as a transitional engine between the Ha 25 and the Ha 115, both of which were mass produced. Specifically built for very low fuel consumption, only four are known to have been built.
In January 1940, the Asahi Press requested the Aeronautical Research Institute of the University of Tokyo to design a long-distance record-breaking aircraft with a range exceeding 15,000 km (9,321 miles) and minimum cruising speed of 300 km/h (186 mph). With approval of the Japanese Army, the project received the designation A-26 (A referring to Asahi and 26 for the Japanese year, 2600 (A.D. 1940)).
The aircraft was eventually powered by the higher powered Ha 115 Toku engines. With the onset of World War II, the objective changed to making the plane a long-range communication aircraft, and redesignated Tachikawa Ki-77 Army Experimental Long-range Research Plane. Two prototype aircraft were built before the War ended.
Douglas DC-7
The Douglas DC-7 was an advanced development of the
DC-6B piston-engine airliner. It was introduced by American Airlines on its New York–Los Angeles route in November 1953 and was the first airliner to provide nonstop transcontinental service in both directions.
The fastest transport aircraft in service, the DC-7 cruised at 580 kilometers (360 miles) per hour. A total of 338 DC-7s of all types were purchased by 18 different airlines. Like other piston-engine airliners, it was made obsolete by the introduction of turbine-engine Boeing 707s and Douglas
DC-8s. Some DC-7s later served as cargo and charter planes.
This nose section is from American Airlines’ Flagship Vermont, which carried about 130,000 passengers in its nearly 13,500 hours aloft.

The Wasp Jr. R-985 was the third engine type designed by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, following the Wasp R-1340 and Hornet R-1690, all of which were nine-cylinder engines. Virtually a Wasp of reduced dimensions, the Wasp Jr. followed closely the details of construction throughout. The Wasp Jr., originally rated at 224 kW (300 hp), was first type certificated in January 1930. Designed for light transports, trainers, sport aircraft, and helicopters, number of R-985 models were made, most at 298 kW (400 hp) or more power. The R-985 powered a wide variety and large number of military and commercial aircraft, making it one of the most successful reciprocating engines ever built in its power class.
The Jacobs Aircraft Engine Company of Pottstown, Pennsylvania built this Pratt & Whitney-designed R-985-AN5. Jacobs converted it for vertical helicopter installation. It powered the Sikorsky XH-5, YH-5A/D/E, H-5A/D/F/G and Kellett YH-10 helicopters.
The Beechcraft Model 18 made its first demonstration flight in 1937 and production continued for an impressive thirty-two years, with move than 9,000 aircraft built. The low-wing, all-metal, twin-engine monoplane was originally intended as a six-to-eight passenger executive or feeder airline transport, but eventually thirty-two versions were built. The highly adaptable design became a mail plane, a utility aircraft, and a distance and speed record breaker. Military versions included personnel transport, photo reconnaissance, and trainers for navigators and bombardiers.
The success of the Beech 18 ensured the success of Beech Aircraft Corporation throughout the 1940s. Beech introduced the D-18S model in October 1945, with structural modifications for increased payload and new engines and landing gear. Mike Mitchell operated N522B as an air ambulance for fifteen years, flying it a million and one-quarter miles and transporting nearly fifteen thousand patients.
With this camera, an Ansco Autoset model, astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr., took the first human-captured, color still photographs of the Earth during his three-orbit mission on February 20, 1962. Glenn's pictures paved the way for future Earth photography experiments on American human spaceflight missions.
For ease of use by Glenn, NASA technicians attached a pistol grip handle and trigger to this commercial 35-mm camera, which is upside down from its normal orientation. Because Glenn was wearing a spacesuit helmet and could not get his eye close to a built-in viewfinder, NASA engineers attached a larger viewfinder on top. Glenn found the camera easy to use, in part because he could exploit zero-gravity's advantages. "When I needed both hands, I just let go of the camera and it floated there in front of me," he said in his later memoir.
NASA transferred this camera to the Smithsonian in 1963.
Mooney Mite N3199K is serial number one of the fast and efficient line of private aircraft designed by Albert Mooney and Charles Yankey. Mooney Aircraft Corporation produced more than 365 Mites between 1947 and 1955 and followed them with the larger M.20 series. Current Mooney aircraft still sport the trademark forward-swept vertical fin of the original Mite.
The compact, single-place, low-wing monoplane boasted retractable landing gear and wing flaps, new amenities for personal planes of that era. Mooney's patented "Safe-Trim" system featured a moveable horizontal stabilizer interconnected to the flaps for automatic nose-attitude trim. After replacing the original 25 hp Crosley Cobra engine with a Continental or Lycoming, Mites became lively record-setters, cruising at a brisk 200 km/h (125 mph).
This liquid oxygen flow regulator was tested by the American rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard (1882-1945) about July 1926. There were two of these devices, each placed on the ends of liquid oxygen pipes. Within each regulator (within the cylindrical cage formed by the regulators) Goddard placed a cork. As the liquid oxygen flowed through these pipes, a certain amount of condensation was allowed to escape through holes at the bottom of each regulator. The corks thus freely moved upward within the cage, but only to the top of the cage, and therefore limited how much condensation could be released.
Mrs. Robert H. Goddard donated this object to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 as part of a large collection of artifacts from her husband.
This is a Vanguard TV-2BU rocket, the U.S.'s first rocket specifically designed to launch satellites. As part of the Vanguard program, the Vanguard TV-2BU test vehicle was prepared for launch by the Martin Company on September 3, 1957. But due to a technical problem the mission was cancelled. The next launch opportunity was on June 22, 1959. However, the TV-4BU test version of the Vanguard was launched instead and orbited Vanguard 3.
Meanwhile, on March 17, 1958, the first successful Vanguard satellite was launched as Vanguard 1 atop a Vanguard TV-3BU rocket. The TV-2BU rocket was thus never used in the program but was essentially a duplicate of the Vanguard 1 vehicle and had the same markings. This TV-2BU was donated to the Smithsonian in 1958 by the Naval Research Lab.
Aichi chief engineer, Toshio Ozaki, designed the M6A1 Seiran to fulfill the requirement for a bomber that could operate exclusively from a submarine. Japanese war planners devised the idea as a means for striking directly at the United States mainland and other important strategic targets, like the Panama Canal, that lay thousands of kilometers from Japan. To support Seiran operations, the Japanese developed a fleet of submarine aircraft carriers to bring the aircraft within striking distance. No Seiran ever saw combat, but the Seiran/submarine weapons system represents an ingenious blend of aviation and marine technology.
This M6A1 was the last airframe built (serial number 28) and the only surviving example of the Seiran in the world. Imperial Japanese Navy Lt. Kazuo Akatsuka ferried this Seiran from Fukuyama to Yokosuka where he surrendered it to an American occupation contingent.
Beginning in 1911, the Sturtevant Manufacturing Co. produced a number of engine models, all water cooled in-line vertical and V-types. Later absorbed into the family’s B.F. Sturtevant Co., which was a long time manufacturer of industrial fans; it was one of a number of early aircraft engine manufacturers whose products were very similar to automobile engines.
Unlike most of its rivals, this engine was equipped with L-head rather than overhead valves. It powered Burgess, Curtiss, Wright, and Sturtevant seaplanes, many of which were purchased by the U.S. government. It was also used in several privately-owned land planes. The artifact was removed from the Herring-Burgess aircraft that is in the museum’s collection.
Later, in 1915, the Sturtevant Aeroplane Co. was organized to build aircraft, and obviously used Sturtevant engines. The entire Sturtevant aviation venture was unsuccessful, ending after 1919.
On Oct. 26, 1925, U.S. Army Lt. James H. Doolittle flew the Curtiss R3C-2 to victory in the Schneider Trophy Race with an average speed of 374 km/h (232.17 mph). The next day he flew the R3C-2 over a straight course at a world-record speed of 395 km/h (245.7 mph). In the Schneider Trophy Race of Nov. 13, 1926, this same airplane piloted by Lt. Christian F. Schilt, USMC, and piloted by an improved engine, won second place with an average speed of 372 km/h (231.4 mph).
This is American Rocket Society (ARS) Test Stand Stand No. 2 used in ground tests of experimental rocket motors. Built in 1938, it had a thrust capacity of 200 pounds.
The stand notably proved the effectiveness of James H. Wyld's regeneratively-cooled motor in tests from 1938 to 1941. This led Wyld and three other ARS members to form Reaction Motors, Inc. (RMI) in 1941, America's first commercial liquid-fuel rocket company which later built the 6000-pound thrust rocket engine for the Bell X-1 research rocket aircraft that broke the sound barrier in October 1947.
The stand was last used in 1942 when loaned to RM. It then was loaned in 1953 to the ARS. It was donated to the Smithsonian in 1967 by the Reaction Motors Division, Thiokol Chemical Corp.
This Geraldine Ferraro campaign button was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. Ferraro was Walter Mondale's running mate on the Democratic ticket in the 1984 presidential election, and had she been elected, she would have been America's first woman Vice President. During her acceptance speech at the party convention, Ferraro cited Sally Ride's achievement as the first American woman in space as evidence that "change is in the air." Ride saw Ferraro's nomination as inspirational, and said about the DNC speech, "I was as moved by that as many women had been by my flight into space. For the first time, I understood why it was such an emotional experience for so many people, to see me accomplish what I had, as a woman." Ride was a strong supporter of Ferraro and visited her at her congressional office a few months prior to the election, posing for photos with her and a t-shirt that Ride had given her bearing the vice-presidential insignia.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the button to the Museum in 2013.
Australian Bill Bennett helped promote hang gliding in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Bennett's first gliders were kites for water skiers, such as the Model 162. He based these designs on a flexible wing that Francis Rogallo evaluated while working for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The space agency hoped to develop a recovery system for Gemini and Apollo capsules (see NASM collection) that allowed astronauts to steer the capsule to a landing as an alternative to unguided parachutes. The difficulties the agency experienced trying to recover the Mercury capsules (see NASM collection), and the near tragedy that followed Gus Grissom's splashdown in July 1961, no doubt encouraged NASA to investigate alternative capsule recovery systems.
Bennett produced ten different models of towed ski kite gliders based on the Rogallo flexible wing. Each was identified by the overall length of the glider in inches, measured at the keel tube. The first models were called the 162, 174, 186, 198, and 210. Gliders with longer keel tubes also had leading edge tubes of greater span and larger wing areas that could lift heavier pilots. The Model 162 could safely support a pilot weighing only 59 kg (130 lb), while the Model 210 could accommodate a pilot weighing up to 113 kg (250 lb).
Piloted by A. Scott Crossfield, on November 20, 1953, the Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket became the first aircraft to fly faster than Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. Air-launched from a U.S. Navy Boeing P2B-1S (B-29) the swept-wing, rocket-powered D-558-2 reached Mach 2.005 in a shallow dive at 18,898 meters (62,000 feet).
The D-558 series of aircraft was developed by Douglas under the direction of Edward H. Heinemann for the U.S. Navy to explore transonic and supersonic flight. The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA, the predecessor to NASA), used this Skyrocket, the second one built, to explore the flight characteristics of swept-wing aircraft. It set several other speed and altitude records before the program ended in 1956.
Jimmy Doolittle used this radio receiver to “fly the beam,” which was a radio signal that actuated a vibrating reed to indicate if he was on course. The American Radio Corporation built the device in 1929.
Samuel Pierpont Langley became the third Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in 1887. In 1891, he began experiments with large, tandem-winged models powered by small steam and gasoline engines he called aerodromes. After several failures with designs that were too fragile and under-powered to sustain themselves, Langley had his first genuine success on May 6, 1896, with his Aerodrome Number 5. It made the world's first successful flight of an unpiloted, engine-driven, heavier-than-air craft of substantial size. It was launched from a spring-actuated catapult mounted on top of a houseboat on the Potomac River near Quantico, Virginia. Two flights were made on May 6, one of 1,005 m (3,300 ft) and a second of 700 m (2,300 ft), at a speed of approximately 40 kph (25 mph). On both occasions, the Aerodrome Number 5 landed in the water, as planned, because, in order to save weight, it was not equipped with landing gear.
Launched in 1960, Echo 1 was designed to explore the new field of communications via space. Its design was remarkably simple: Essentially a large balloon, measuring 30 meters (100 feet) across, the satellite provided a reflective surface in space. Radio signals directed at Echo from one location on Earth "bounced" to another. By the time Echo 2 was launched in 1964, other types of communications satellites had proven superior, and researchers used the Echos primarily for scientific experiments.
Echo satellites, manufactured by the G.T. Schjeldahl Co., posed a unique technical challenge. They were sent into orbit folded flat and then inflated in space. Inflation had to proceed carefully to ensure the integrity of the satellite's "balloon" surface. This one is a flight spare folded in its launch canister.
The National Museum of American History transferred this artifact to the Museum in 2003.
Samuel Langley's aeronautical experiments appeared to have concluded with the successful flights of his Aerodromes Number 5 and Number 6 in 1896, but privately he intended to build a full-sized, human-carrying airplane. Langley's simple approach was merely to scale up the unpiloted Aerodromes of 1896 to human-carrying proportions. The construction details and distribution of stresses on the Aerodrome A, as the full-sized version was called, were based on the successful performance of a gasoline-powered model, one-fourth the size. This exact scale miniature, known as the Quarter-scale Aerodrome, made two flights of 46 m (150 ft) and 108 m (350 ft) on June 18, 1901, powered by a five-cylinder radial internal combustion gasoline engine of about 3.2 horsepower. Between 1901 and 1903, the engine was rebuilt to produce slightly more than three horsepower, after which a final flight of 308 m (1,000 ft) was made on August 8, 1903. Because the structural and control requirements for a full-sized, piloted airplane were very different, the satisfactory flights of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome masked its flaws as a design prototype for the Aerodrome A. When twice attempted to fly in 1903, the Aerodrome A met with disastrous results, ending Langley's aeronautical experiments entirely.
This first aid kit was part of the equipment assigned to John Glenn for his historic Friendship 7 mission in February, 1962.
The kit is small, and contained minor first aid supplies for use in the event of a minor mishap.
The Mars Science Laboratory, Curiosity, successfully landed on the red planet on August 6, 2012, after nearly a year traveling from Earth. At that time Curiosity began a multi-year mission to explore the Gale Crater and to climb Mt. Sharp in its center. Curiosity brought to the red planet’s surface a formidable life sciences laboratory that may well help resolve beyond serious question whether or not life ever existed on Mars. This rover is the first full-scale astrobiology mission to Mars since the Viking landers of 1976. Having followed the water, and found evidence of it, Curiosity now seeks to answer if Mars could have supported—or might still support—life. Mars Curiosity has ten different instruments designed to help find the answer to this question. It will look for processes that might have preserve clues about life, either now or in the past, on the red planet.
Transferred from NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory to the Museum in 2016.
The B-3 was used on bombers and transports when ground or water could be clearly seen. It evolved from the earlier Gatty drift meters.
Originating in Iowa to build automobiles, the Duesenberg Motors Corporation of Elizabeth, New Jersey was organized in 1917 by German immigrant Fred Duesenberg, one of America’s leading designers of internal combustion engines.
The company’s engines grew from a four-cylinder in-line model to a twelve-cylinder V-type. Apparently the company’s last aircraft engine, Duesenberg designed and built the Model H during World War I with both direct and geared propeller drives. Swinging a giant 4.88 m (16-foot)-diameter propeller, it developed as much as 597 kW (800 horsepower). The Armistice ended the need for such a powerful and costly power plant.
The U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps and the air forces of 12 other nations have flown the multi-role Phantom II. In this aircraft, then a Navy F-4J, on June 21, 1972, Cmdr. S. C. Flynn and his radar intercept officer, Lt. W. H. John, spotted three enemy MiG fighters off the coast of Vietnam and shot down one MiG-21 with a Sidewinder air-to-air missile. This Phantom also flew combat air patrols and bombing missions during the Linebacker II bombing campaign that same year.
Later assigned to the Marine Corps, this F-4J was extensively modernized and designated an F-4S. Changes included improving the engines (smokeless), hydraulics, electronics, and wiring; modifying the wings to increase maneuverability; and adding a radar homing and warning antenna, as well as formation tape lights on the fuselage and vertical tail.
Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, took this transmitter and other radio equipment on their 1931 flight to the Orient and 1933 survey flights across the North and South Atlantic. Because they were flying over vast stretches of unchartered territory in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia during their 1931 flight and Greenland, Africa, and Brazil during their 1933 flight, the Lindberghs relied on radio and navigation equipment to help them find their remote destinations.
Anne, who served as co-pilot, operated all of the radio equipment during the Lindberghs' two trans-global flights, performing an impressive daily workload, and set a telegraph transmission distance record. Prior to the 1931 flight she worked hard to learn Morse code and earn her radio operator's license. She eventually became skilled at using complex radio equipment such as this transmitter, but at first she felt she needed four hands to perform "acrobatics:" two to tune the dials, one to write down the incoming message, and one to hold her pad of paper.
Elmer Sperry developed the Stallemometer as a follow-on component to the first successful aircraft autopilot, demonstrated by Sperry in 1914. The Stallemometer detected a stall flutter and then function as a switch to drop the nose by twenty degrees through the autopilot until a stall recovery occurred. A light provided a further warning that the stall had occurred and a recovery was underway. Like the autopilot itself, the Stallemometer was not seen by aviators as a desirable innovation due to cost, weight, complexity and its subsuming of pilot control over the flight. Such systems did enjoy a resurgance fifty years later as increasing levels of autopilot autonomy became standard on larger transport aircraft.
With this camera, a Leica 1g model, astronaut John H. Glenn, Jr.,carried out the first human-operated, astronomical experiment in space during his pioneering mission on February 20, 1962. On his first orbit, in darkness over the Pacific, Glenn took six ultraviolet spectrographic photos of stars in the constellation Orion with this camera. Equipped with a quartz lens and prism to form the star images into spectra, the camera imaged ultraviolet light that is blocked from view on Earth by the atmosphere.
Because Glenn was wearing a spacesuit helmet and could not get his eye close to a built-in viewfinder, NASA selected a this high-quality camera that allowed them to attach a customized reticle on top. To stabilize the camera, he closed his helmet visor and placed the recticle against the visor, cushioned using a small piece of blue rubber.
NASA transferred this camera to the Smithsonian in 1963 with a group of Glenn artifacts.
In early 1930, Allison manager N. H. Gilman sketched a design for a 559 kW (750-hp), 12-cylinder engine that would incorporate high-temperature glycol cooling and a turbosupercharger. The U.S. Navy contracted with Allison to supply the engine (known as the V-1710-A) for use on its airships. Originally known for modified Liberty engines and developing propeller reduction gears, this was the first of Allison’s own engines. Two years later the Army ordered a modified, more powerful version; redesigned during development and reintroduced in 1936 as the V-1710-C6.
Allison built more than 47,000 V-1710s in 57 versions. During World War II they powered various models of the Lockheed P-38, Curtiss P-40, Bell P-39 and P-63, and North American P-51. This artifact was the first Allison V-1710 engine to be flown. The Army Air Corps bought it in 1936 and flew it for 300 hours in the Consolidated XA-11A attack aircraft.
This is a 1-inch solid fuel rocket built and tested by U.S. rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard during 1917-1918 for the U.S. Army for potential use as a weapon during World War I. The experiments were undertaken near the Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California. Later, a trial was made before Army officers at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland, on 6 November 1918.
The trials went well and this model reached about 750 yards. However, the following day the armistice was signed that ended the war as well as the Army's interest in this project. Goddard switched to liquid propellants in 1921. This object was donated to the Smithsonian by the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics in 1985.
Mariner 10 was the seventh successful launch in the Mariner series and the first spacecraft to use the gravitational pull of one planet (Venus) to reach another (Mercury). It was also the first probe to visit two planets. Launched on November 3, 1973, it reached Venus on February 5, 1974. Using a gravity assist from this planet, Mariner 10 first crossed the orbit of Mercury on March 29, 1974 and did so a second time on September 21, 1974. A third and last Mercury encounter took place on March 16, 1975. It measured the environments of both Venus and Mercury. It then undertook experiments in the interplanetary medium. Mariner 10 showed that Venus had at best a weak magnetic field, and the ionosphere interacted with the solar wind to form a bow shock. At Mercury, it confirmed that Mercury had no atmosphere and a cratered, dormant Moon-like surface.
This flight spare was transferred from NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory to the Museum in 1982.
The Autosyn was a system developed by the Eclipse-Pioneer Division of the Bendix Aviation Corporation to eliminate the cumbersome plumbing required for instrumentation in increasingly large aircraft. Instead of having many feet of piping, vulnerable to blockage or leaks, the autosyn system used a transmitter located at the source of the input that converted the mechanical or electro-mechanical impulses from a sensor into electrical signals that were sent to a standardized indicator on the instrument panel. The indicator would have a simple easily mounted face that was appropriate to the input sensed by the transmitter.
In 1974, Tom Jewett and Gene Sheehan decided to begin designing an airplane that would provide "more flying enjoyment for less money" than other homebuilt aircraft designs popular at that time. Burt Rutan (Rutan VariEze and Voyager, see NASM collection) assisted Jewett and Sheehan in the design work and the first Quickie was finished, tested in flight, and ready for a public introduction by April 1978. In June, the two men formed the Quickie Aircraft Corporation to produce and sell complete kits to build the aircraft. They flew the airplane to the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in June where the Quickie drew intense public interest and won the Outstanding New Design award. By 1980, the firm had sold 350 kits.
The Quickie is a single-place, single-engined aircraft fitted with a canard approximately equal in area to the main wing. The layout almost qualifies the aircraft as a biplane with tremendous negative stagger between the upper and lower wings. Construction methods remain identical to other Rutan designs. A builder cuts foam cores for the various components and covers them with resin and fiberglass cloth. Rutan envisioned powering the Quickie with an Onan industrial generator engine that developed 22 horsepower but many builders found this motor too weak. A 2-place version, propelled by a 64 horsepower engine and called the Q-2, was also developed. The Q-200, equipped with a modified lower wing and powered by an 85 horsepower engine, also flew. Various organizations sold Approximately 1,000 Quickie kits and 2,000 Q-2 and Q-200 kits.
The first Lear Jets, the Model 23s, were the first products of the original Lear Jet Corporation for the new field of business and personal jet aviation. So significant was the design that for years "Lear Jet" was synonymous with "bizjet." William P. Lear Sr. initiated the Lear Jet's development in 1959. The aircraft drew upon the structural quality of the Swiss AFA P-16 strike-fighter and featured a fuselage that narrowed at each side where the wing and engine nacelles extended outward-a design concept known as area rule-to provide smooth airflow around the engines.
Successive Lear Jet models set many speed records. In production since 1964, the Lear Jet line closed in 2021. This is the second protoype Model 23 and was used as a test aircraft.
This rotary-wing kite allowed German submarines to locate targets in heavy seas. Towed aloft by Type IX D2 U-Boats to a maximum altitude of 220 meters, the pilot had a possible sighting distance of 53 kilometers. U-Boat commanders disliked the Fa 330, because it gave away the location of the submarine, both visually and on radar. Only U-Boats operating in the Indian Ocean deployed them, because Allied naval superiority in the Atlantic Ocean made surfacing in the daylight extremely hazardous.
A crew of four could assemble and disassemble the Fa 330 in three minutes. When not in use, the aircraft remained stowed in two watertight tubes in the U-Boat's conning tower. The pilot communicated his observations by a telephone line that ran along the tow cable. The Fa 330 was simple to fly, and an ingenious parachute system allowed the pilot to escape from the aircraft at relatively low altitudes.
The Sunbeam Motor Car Co., Ltd of Wolverhampton, England began producing successful automobiles in 1910. Applying the expertise of French Chief Engineer Louis Coatalen, its first aircraft engines were designed in 1913. A total of 350 Cossack engines were produced between August 1914 and December 1918. These engines powered the: Handley Page H.P.11 O/100 Type O; Short 310-A4 and Short 310-B North Sea Scout; R36 (Beardmore) Admiralty dirigible airship and R38 (Royal Airship Works) Admiralty dirigible airship. Sunbeam’s engines were the favored supplier to the Royal Navy Air Service until late in World War I. After Coatalen’s return to France in 1923, Sunbeam effectively left the aircraft engine business.
This Cossack engine was built by the Sterling Engine Company of Buffalo, New York, a leading American manufacturer of marine engines, which undertook to build Sunbeam aircraft engines during 1917. However, only a few of the twelve-cylinder units were constructed before the work was finally abandoned.
George Hare developed the Patent Field Camera in London in 1882 and this plate camera recevied modifications over the years including adaptation to roll film. American Wesley D. Archer used this camera for photography during his RAF service during World War I.
Upon his return to the U.S. in 1920, Archer became a set designer and worked on movie productions. Archer honed his model building skills and assembled numerous replicas of World War I aircraft such as Fokkers, Albatrosses, S.E.5s and Nieuports. With these models and a camera, Archer fabricated aerial combat photographs. People thought they were authentic and boasted them as the best aerial combat pictures ever taken. G.P. Putnam's Sons publishing house in New York featured his photographs in an exhibition of aviation art titled, "The World in the Air." The popularity of the photographs increased when the book, Death in the Air: The War Diary and Photographs of a Flying Corps Pilot, written by Archer himself, was published in 1933. In it he created personas and a story about a RFC pilot who took a camera from a downed German aircraft and rigged it under his wing in order to take the pictures. His wife Betty participated in the hoax by posing as Gladys Maud Cockburn-Lange and sold the photographs, known as the Cockburn-Lange collection, to numerous individuals and publishing companies. The truth about the Archer's hoax was discovered in the 1980's by Peter Grosz and NASM curatorial assistant Karl Schneide when the museum received the collection from Archer's friend, John Charlton.
The Predator can provide near real-time reconnaissance using a satellite data link system and perform attack missions as well. It served over the Balkans and Afghanistan and during Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003. The most historic use of the Predator/Hellfire missile combination occurred when CIA ground forces directed attacks against al Qaeda forces during the opening months of the war on terrorism.
This U.S. Air Force Predator was one of the first three UAVs to fly operational missions over Afghanistan after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It went on to fly 196 combat missions in Afghanistan. It was also the first Predator to test fire the Hellfire missile, and the first UAV to fire Hellfire missiles in combat. With modifications to its wing length, propeller, avionics, and engine cooling system, it has served as the prototype for subsequent MQ-IL aircraft.
This Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) was one of four built by NASA for astronauts returning from the Moon. Its purpose was to prevent the unlikely spread of lunar pathogens by isolating the astronauts from contact with other people. A converted Airstream trailer, the MQF contained living and sleeping quarters, a kitchen, and a bathroom. Quarantine was assured by keeping the air pressure inside lower than the pressure outside and by filtering the air vented from the facility.
This MQF was used by Apollo 11 astronauts Neil Armstrong, Buzz Aldrin, and Michael Collins immediately after their return to Earth. They, together with a physician and a technician, remained in it for over 60 hours while the MQF was transported on the aircraft carrier USS Hornet to the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii and from there to nearby Hickam AFB. At Hickam, the MQF was loaded into the cargo hold of a C-141 aircraft and flown to Ellington AFB in Houston, Texas. The MQF, with the astronauts still on board, was then transported to the NASA Lunar Receiving Laboratory at Johnson Space Center where there were more spacious quarantine facilities. The astronauts were allowed to emerge from quarantine once scientists were sure they were not infected with "moon germs."
NASA transferred the MQF to the Smithsonian Institution in 1974.
Rebecca / Eureka is a simple system designed initially to assist in the delivery of supplies to the Army or Resistance in occupied Europe. The system expanded into blind homing and approach aid for aircraft. Much of the credit for the development of this system must go to Dr.R.Hanbury-Brown and J.W.S.Pringle of the TRE (Telecommunications Research Establishment)
Principles
The Airborne Rebecca equipment radiates about 300 times a second a 4-5 uSec duration interrogating puls on a spot frequency. On receipt of the interrogating pulses the Eureka beacon located on the ground triggers its associated transmitter causing responses to be radiated on a different frequency but at a pulse recurrence frequency of the interrogating transmitter. The returned signal received on both the right and left Rebecca receiver aerials are displayed on a cathode ray tube in which the time-base is synchronised with the original pulse from the Rebecca transmitter and applied to the Y-plates of the cathode ray tube. The received signals are switched into the receiver in synchronism with the switching of the video-frequency output signals to the right and left hand X-plates of the cathode ray tube. In this way, if the beacon is to the right the signal to the right of the time base will have a greater amplitude, in which case a right turn will be necessary to make the signals on either side of the time base equal in amplitude and the aircraft will then be flying directly towards the beacon.
The Eureka transponder was based on a super regenerative receiver with a separate Transmitter valve and powered by a battery operated vibrator. A coding unit which is part of the Eureka beacon periodically causes the width of the beacon response pulses to vary at Morse code intervals for identification. This function may also be manually controlled for transmission of simple messages.

The Blériot Type XI was designed primarily by Raymond Saulnier, but it was a natural evolution from earlier Blériot aircraft, and one to which Louis Blériot himself made substantial contributions. Blériot achieved immortality in the Type XI on July 25, 1909, when he made the first airplane crossing of the English Channel, covering the 40 km (25 mi) between Calais and Dover in 36 minutes, 30 seconds.
The Blériot XI in the NASM collection was manufactured in 1914 and was powered by a 50-horsepower Gnôme rotary engine. The airplane was purchased by the Swiss aviator John Domenjoz, a Blériot company flight instructor. Domenjoz earned a reputation as one of the era's most celebrated stunt pilots, performing in major European cities and in North and South America through 1916, at which time he returned to France. Following wartime service as a civilian flight instructor both in France and the United States, Domenjoz made one final barnstorming tour with his Blériot in 1919.
Aircrew forced down at sea used surface flares like this one from NC-3 to signal their position to rescuers.
In Canada in 1978, Dale Kramer designed the Lazair and he and Peter Corley built the first prototype. This was one of the first twin-engine ultralights and the configuration marked an important step to increase the reliability of these simple and inexpensive aircraft. He and Corley built the aircraft from aluminum sheets and tubing, and then covered the wings with transparent mylar. The SS EC model is one of several that the Ultraflight (with an 'f') factory produced. All Lazairs shared the same basic airframe, but each model was equipped with different engines, a different cockpit enclosure, and structural modifications to support increases in engine power.
The Lazair was among the first ultralights to attract serious attention from police officers interested in using these airplanes to aid law-enforcement. The twin tractor engines promised increased reliability and the factory could install electric starting as an option to ease operations on the ground and in the air. Police surveillance pilots also preferred the airplane-style, stick-and-rudder flight controls. Many other ultralights still used some form of weight-shift controls at this time.
This particular aircraft was the second ultralight tested by officers of the Monterey Park Police Department in California. This group was the first unit in the nation to experiment with an ultralight aircraft used in a surveillance role. Monterey Park city and police department officials also generously donated that first airplane, an American Aerolights Double Eagle, to the NASM collection.
Pierre Clerget was inspired by the Gnome to produce a supposedly improved rotary engine in 1911. It was a 7-cylinder, 11.88 liter (725 cu in) engine rated at 60 kW (80 hp) at 1,200 rpm. Thousands of these engines were manufactured in France and Britain. Larger 9-cylinder rotary engines began production in 1913. In the 1920s, Clerget transitioned to 4-stroke diesel engines, which initially had dimensions similar to the rotaries.
The Clerget 9A was built by Clerget, Blin, and Cie of Paris, France, with development beginning in 1928. On September 28, 1929, in a Morane 135 aircraft, it became the first diesel aircraft engine to fly in France. This engine was followed by the 149 kW (200 shp) 9B in 1930, the 186 kW (250 shp) 9Br (which was reversible in flight) in 1931, and the 224 kW (300 shp) 9C in 1932.
During World War II, Westland Lysander crews flew highly classified clandestine missions from England over Axis territory. Many of their operational missions remain tightly locked in official secrecy. The Lysander was designed to land and take off from places normally unrecognizable as airfields. The aircraft operated comfortably from pastures, fields, and even clearings in the forest and was effective at inserting secret agents deep into enemy territory.
The museum's Lysander was built in Canada in 1942. Little is known about its service history, but it likely flew as an aerial tow plane for target practice. This aircraft is painted in the colors of 138 Squadron RAF. During World War II, this squadron was based at RAF Tempsford Airfield. It was controlled by the Special Operations Executive and flew clandestine missions supplying resistance forces and transporting agents to and from occupied Europe.
This spacefood package contains pureed beef with vegetables and was issued to John Glenn for consumption during his Friendship 7 flight in February 1962.
Spacefood for the Mercury missions was placed in tube form to enable the astronaut to squeeze it directly into his mouth. In the later Gemini and Apollo missions, food was dehydrated requiring rehydration with hot water and could be eaten directly from the plastic storage bag.
Transferred to the national Air and Space Museum from NASA in 1967.
The RQ-7A provides ground commanders the ability to "see first, understand first, and act first-decisively." The twin-boom pusher aircraft performs day or night reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, and bomb damage assessment. It has nonretractable landing gear for conventional takeoff and landing, but it can also be launched by catapult and use a tail hook and arresting cables for a shorter landing.
A Shadow 200 system consists of four RQ-7As and two ground control stations, which transmit tactical reconnaissance imagery and telemetry data in near real time directly to combat command centers. The RQ-7A entered service with the U.S. Army in 2002 and flew its first mission over Baghdad in April 2003 during Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Screamin' Demon flew with the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and the 82nd Airborne Division. Its last combat flight in Iraq took place in 2005. It flew 124 missions totaling nearly 500 flight hours.
An important objective of the Roberts Motor Company design was light weight, which was achieved through the extensive use of aluminum and magnesium alloys in the cylinders and crankcase, a hollow crankshaft, and two-stroke cycle operation (to reduce parts count). Between 1911 and 1912, Roberts engines were used by many noted exhibition pilots, and more Roberts engines were said to be built than by Hall-Scott and Curtiss combined.
This engine was purchased by Oscar R. Solbrig of Davenport, Iowa, to power the Curtiss-type pusher aircraft he built in 1911-12. Solbrig, who had received aviation training from Curtiss, soloed in his own aircraft in 1912. He later flew exhibition flights and races with it at county fairs, sports events, and exposition parks in Iowa and Illinois. This artifact is apparently rare because the standard Roberts 4X engine used a 114 mm (4.5 in.) bore, resulting in a 5.21 L (318 cu. in,) displacement.
Gabriel and Charles Voisin were among Europe's leading pioneer aviators. Their classic 1907 pusher biplane was one of the most significant aircraft of the pre-World War I era. In 1912, they developed a military version. Thereafter they built aircraft almost exclusively for military contracts. The Voisin 1912 Type, as it was referred to by the French military, also called the Type 1, launched the standard configuration of almost all Voisin aircraft throughout the war. The Voisin design philosophy was conservative. There were only slight, incremental design changes in the airframes during the war. Improvements principally consisted of installing more powerful engines, usually necessitating wings of greater span. The Voisin Type 8 entered service with French night bombing squadrons in November 1916.
NASM's Voisin Type 8 is the oldest surviving aircraft that was specifically designed as a bomber. When manufactured in February 1916, it was equipped as a night bomber, with internal bomb racks, cockpit lights, and provision for landing lights.
Original 36-inch reflecting telescope that flew on the Shuttle twice as part of the ASTRO mission. It employs a medium dispersion spectrometer at a modified prime focus. It was designed to observe faint celestial objects in the ultraviolet region of the spectrum. On the first mission in December 1990 the instrument observed over 75 astronomical sources including active galactic nuclei, quasars, variable stars and supernova remnants. After this successful mission it was modified to concentrate on the relatively unknown far-ultraviolet region and flown on Astro-2 in March 1995. Observations from this second flight provided a wealth of data including the first clear detection of the distribution of intergalactic helium left over from the Big Bang. Its calculated distribution in the pre-galaxy formation Universe fits the bubble and void geometry seen in the earliest and present universe. The telescope was manufactured by the Center for Astrophysical Sciences and the Applied Physics Lab of Johns Hopkins University. It was transferred by NASA in 2001.
This Block II Apollo Command and Service Module combination (CSM 105), manufactured by North American Rockwell, was originally used for vibration and acoustic tests. In 1973 it was refurbished for display at the Paris Air Show. The CSM was displayed docked to a Soviet Soyuz spacecraft, as was planned for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Program (ASTP) mission that took place in July 1975. The Soyuz spacecraft was made of residual test hardware.
In 1976 this combined exhibit was installed in the National Air and Space Museum after its transfer from NASA.
The Bellanca C.F. high-wing monoplane was the prototype for the first line of successful cabin aircraft, including Pacemakers and Cruisairs, built in the United States. Its creator, Italian immigrant Giuseppe Bellanca, embraced a completely new vision and design in the early 1920s, offering four passengers comfort and cover in a cabin while keeping the traditional open cockpit for the pilot.
Bellanca visualized the C.F. as a commercial transport aircraft before a market really existed; therefore, only one C.F. was ever built. However, the beautifully crafted monoplane, with its high-lift struts and mahogany plywood panels, exhibited high performance. It won races in 1922 and 1923 and also hosted two aerial marriages.
The Hall-Scott Motor Car Company, with general offices in San Francisco and factories at Berkeley, California, began specializing in the construction of airplane engines in 1911. The water-cooled 30 kW (40 hp) Type A-1 was the first aircraft engine produced by the company. This was followed the 45 kW (60 shp) Model A-2 and the 60 kW (80 shp) Model A-3, both water-cooled V-8 engines.
The Hall-Scott Model A-7-A primarily powered the World War I Standard Aero Corporation Standard J aircraft. The Standard J and its Hall-Scott A-7-A engine along with the Curtiss JN-4D with its OX-5 engine were the two primary trainer aircraft and engines built in the U.S. during World War I. Despite vibration common to four-cylinder engines at the time, the A-7-A was otherwise regarded by experts as a rugged and dependable motor. The A-7-A also powered other Standard, Aero Marine, and Dayton-Wright aircraft.
Capt. St. Clair Streett and his fellow pilots of the Alaskan Flying Expedition made one of the greatest flights in aviation. They received numerous honors and awards as they journeyed to and from Alaska over 9,000 miles. The Aero Club of America (today’s National Aeronautic Association), the nation’s premier aviation organization, bestowed upon them medals of merit upon their return. As the decades of the 1920s progressed, subsequent flights of spectacle overshadowed the expedition’s achievement, which is largely forgotten today.
John Chotia crafted the basic JC-24 (JC for John Chotia, 24 for his 24th design) airframe in 1976. Few could foresee the Weedhopper's success after it first flew in 1977, but in 2001, dealers in the United States continued to sell single- and two-seat Weedhoppers. When ultralight aircraft were very popular during the 1980s, dealers in Belgium, France, and Italy sold these aircraft and factories in Europe, and the Middle East built them under license. By 2002, dealers had sold nearly 15,000 Weedhoppers.
In response to the loss of air superiority in late 1917, the Germans organized a competition for new fighter designs held in January 1918. The in-line engine winner was the Fokker D.VII. Fokker received an order for 400 aircraft. To meet the demand for the new fighter, Albatros, Fokker's chief competitor, also built the D.VII under license. Ironically, Albatros built more D.VIIs than the primary contractor and the Albatros product was of higher quality. The Fokker D.VII in the NASM collection was built by Albatros.
When the Fokker D.VII appeared on the Western Front in April 1918, Allied pilots at first underestimated the new fighter because of its squarish, ungainly appearance, but quickly revised their view. The D.VII's unique ability to seemingly "hang on its propeller," and fire into the unprotected underside of enemy aircraft made it a highly feared combat opponent. The Armistice agreement requirement specifically demanding that all Fokker D.VIIs be immediately surrendered attested to the general high regard for the airplane.
Each member of the World Flight carried a stuffed monkey as a mascot. "Maggie" was carried on board the "Boston" as a good luck charm. It was signed on the side by "Boston" pilot Lt. Leigh Wade.
Amelia Earhart used this Western Wireless Type 7 radio receiver on her 1935 solo, nonstop flight from Hawaii to Oakland in her Lockheed 5C Vega. It was donated to the museum by Paul Mantz, a well-known movie and racing pilot and a personal friend of Earhart. Mantz served as Earhart's technical advisor for her Honolulu to Oakland and Mexico City to Newark flights, and for early preparations for her 1937 world flight.
On October 14, 1947, the Bell X-1 became the first airplane to fly faster than the speed of sound. Piloted by U.S. Air Force Capt. Charles E. "Chuck" Yeager, the X-1 reached a speed of 1,127 kilometers (700 miles) per hour, Mach 1.06, at an altitude of 13,000 meters (43,000 feet). Yeager named the airplane "Glamorous Glennis" in tribute to his wife.
Air-launched at an altitude of 7,000 meters (23,000 feet) from the bomb bay of a Boeing B-29, the X-1 used its rocket engine to climb to its test altitude. It flew a total of 78 times, and on March 26, 1948, with Yeager at the controls, it attained a speed of 1,540 kilometers (957 miles) per hour, Mach 1.45, at an altitude of 21,900 meters (71,900 feet). This was the highest velocity and altitude reached by a manned airplane up to that time.
William Hawley Bowlus offered the BA-100 Baby Albatross as a series of builders kits advertised in popular magazines to pilots interested in affordable flying at a time when the money for such activities was hard to come by. The kits cost one-fifth the $2,500 asking price of the higher performance Bowlus-du Pont Senior Albatross (see NASM collection). Bowlus made parts for about 90 aircraft and sold between 40 and 60 kits before the start of World War II ended the program.
On July 15, 1954, a graceful, swept-winged aircraft, bedecked in brown and yellow paint and powered by four revolutionary new engines first took to the sky above Seattle. Built by the Boeing Aircraft Company, the 367-80, better known as the Dash 80, would come to revolutionize commercial air transportation when its developed version entered service as the famous Boeing 707, America's first jet airliner.
In the early 1950s, Boeing had begun to study the possibility of creating a jet-powered military transport and tanker to complement the new generation of Boeing jet bombers entering service with the U.S. Air Force. When the Air Force showed no interest, Boeing invested $16 million of its own capital to build a prototype jet transport in a daring gamble that the airlines and the Air Force would buy it once the aircraft had flown and proven itself. As Boeing had done with the B-17, it risked the company on one roll of the dice and won.
Boeing engineers had initially based the jet transport on studies of improved designs of the Model 367, better known to the public as the C-97 piston-engined transport and aerial tanker. By the time Boeing progressed to the 80th iteration, the design bore no resemblance to the C-97 but, for security reasons, Boeing decided to let the jet project be known as the 367-80.
Work proceeded quickly after the formal start of the project on May 20, 1952. The 367-80 mated a large cabin based on the dimensions of the C-97 with the 35-degree swept-wing design based on the wings of the B-47 and B-52 but considerably stiffer and incorporating a pronounced dihedral. The wings were mounted low on the fuselage and incorporated high-speed and low-speed ailerons as well as a sophisticated flap and spoiler system. Four Pratt & Whitney JT3 turbojet engines, each producing 10,000 pounds of thrust, were mounted on struts beneath the wings.
Upon the Dash 80's first flight on July 15, 1954, (the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Boeing Company) Boeing clearly had a winner. Flying 100 miles per hour faster than the de Havilland Comet and significantly larger, the new Boeing had a maximum range of more than 3,500 miles. As hoped, the Air Force bought 29 examples of the design as a tanker/transport after they convinced Boeing to widen the design by 12 inches. Satisfied, the Air Force designated it the KC-135A. A total of 732 KC-135s were built.
Quickly Boeing turned its attention to selling the airline industry on this new jet transport. Clearly the industry was impressed with the capabilities of the prototype 707 but never more so than at the Gold Cup hydroplane races held on Lake Washington in Seattle, in August 1955. During the festivities surrounding this event, Boeing had gathered many airline representatives to enjoy the competition and witness a fly past of the new Dash 80. To the audience's intense delight and Boeing's profound shock, test pilot Alvin "Tex" Johnston barrel-rolled the Dash 80 over the lake in full view of thousands of astonished spectators. Johnston vividly displayed the superior strength and performance of this new jet, readily convincing the airline industry to buy this new airliner.
In searching for a market, Boeing found a ready customer in Pan American Airway's president Juan Trippe. Trippe had been spending much of his time searching for a suitable jet airliner to enable his pioneering company to maintain its leadership in international air travel. Working with Boeing, Trippe overcame Boeing's resistance to widening the Dash-80 design, now known as the 707, to seat six passengers in each seat row rather than five. Trippe did so by placing an order with Boeing for 20 707s but also ordering 25 of Douglas's competing DC-8, which had yet to fly but could accommodate six-abreast seating. At Pan Am's insistence, the 707 was made four inches wider than the Dash 80 so that it could carry 160 passengers six-abreast. The wider fuselage developed for the 707 became the standard design for all of Boeing's subsequent narrow-body airliners.
Although the British de Havilland D.H. 106 Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 entered service earlier, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were bigger, faster, had greater range, and were more profitable to fly. In October 1958 Pan American ushered the jet age into the United States when it opened international service with the Boeing 707 in October 1958. National Airlines inaugurated domestic jet service two months later using a 707-120 borrowed from Pan Am. American Airlines flew the first domestic 707 jet service with its own aircraft in January 1959. American set a new speed mark when it opened the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental jet service in 1959. Subsequent nonstop flights between New York and San Francisco took only 5 hours - 3 hours less than by the piston-engine DC-7. The one-way fare, including a $10 surcharge for jet service, was $115.50, or $231 round trip. The flight was almost 40 percent faster and almost 25 percent cheaper than flying by piston-engine airliners. The consequent surge of traffic demand was substantial.
The 707 was originally designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, the 707-300 Intercontinental series aircraft could fly nonstop across the Atlantic with full payload under any conditions. Boeing built 855 707s, of which 725 were bought by airlines worldwide.
Having launched the Boeing Company into the commercial jet age, the Dash 80 soldiered on as a highly successful experimental aircraft. Until its retirement in 1972, the Dash 80 tested numerous advanced systems, many of which were incorporated into later generations of jet transports. At one point, the Dash 80 carried three different engine types in its four nacelles. Serving as a test bed for the new 727, the Dash 80 was briefly equipped with a fifth engine mounted on the rear fuselage. Engineers also modified the wing in planform and contour to study the effects of different airfoil shapes. Numerous flap configurations were also fitted including a highly sophisticated system of "blown" flaps which redirected engine exhaust over the flaps to increase lift at low speeds. Fin height and horizontal stabilizer width was later increased and at one point, a special multiple wheel low pressure landing gear was fitted to test the feasibility of operating future heavy military transports from unprepared landing fields.
After a long and distinguished career, the Boeing 367-80 was finally retired and donated to the Smithsonian in 1972. At present, the aircraft is installed at the National Air and Space Museum's new facility at Washington Dulles International Airport.
The real Laird Solution won the 1930 Thompson Trophy Race.
The XP-59A is the first American jet aircraft. It did not see combat but it did give the U. S. Army Air Forces (AAF) and the U. S. Navy valuable experience with jet aircraft technology and helped pave the way to more advanced designs. The United States was slow to enter the field of jet propulsion. Political and military leaders wisely chose to forego rushing jet airplanes into service and concentrated instead on mass-producing and fielding more conventional designs that could contribute more quickly to the war effort. Britain's Gloster Meteor fighter served briefly at war's end and the Japanese flew the Nakajima Kikka twice (see NASM collection).
The Germans lead the world in jet-propelled airplanes and the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter and the Arado Ar 234 jet bomber (see NASM collection for these aircraft) both reached operational status. Other types also flew but the technology was so new that it had no measurable effect on the war.
America's first XP-59A, AAF serial number 42-108784, is preserved at the National Air and Space Museum. Shortly the jet's first flight, the Army recognized the need to have an observer on board to record flight test data. They converted the gun bays forward of the pilot to accommodate the observer, cutting a 20-inch hole in the upper skin and mounting a seat, small windscreen, and instrument panel in this rather cramped, open cavity. Flight tests resumed on October 30, 1942, and for the remainder of its AAF career, the aircraft flew in that configuration.
In February 1944, an AAF engineer assigned to the Airacomet project originated the idea of saving America's first jet aircraft for museum display. In August, the Army Air Forces notified Bell that they planned to store the airframe at Muroc and the original engines at Wright Field, Ohio, until they could determine final disposition. The airplane had amassed only 59 hours and 55 minutes of flying time. On April 18, 1945, the Smithsonian asked for the aircraft. Before opening the new National Air and Space Museum in 1976, the staff restored the plane to its original configuration and removed the observer's open cockpit. Befitting its history, the first Airacomet now hangs in the Milestones of Flight gallery.
This artifact is associated with the Wright EX "Vin Fiz," a Wright brothers Model EX aircraft flown by Calbraith Rogers in a 1911 attempt for the first transcontinental flight made in 30 days or less. Sponsored by a company promoting a new grape soda named "Vin Fiz," the flight from New York to California was indeed the first transcontinental flight, but required 70 landings, was plagued by 15 crashes, and missed the prize deadline by 19 days.
Originally, Wright airplanes flew with one left-handed and one right-handed propeller. However, both of the donated aircraft propellers were left-handed. The museum later received a right-handed propeller from a second Wright airplane owned by Rodgers, in which he crashed and was killed in 1912. To make the "Vin Fiz" more accurate, the museum installed that right-handed propeller on the displayed aircraft. This subject artifact is the remaining left-handed propeller from the original "Vin Fiz" donation.
Initially asked in 1914 to study an overheating problem in rotary engines, Captain W. O. Bentley, an established car designer, developed a new and more efficient engine, with a weight-saving effect realized by careful design and the use of aluminum wherever possible. Equally important was the lower cost, as compared to the French Clerget, then widely used in British aircraft; and itself considered an improvement over the earlier Gnome
Following success of the smaller A.R.1 (Admiral Rotary 1), which was later renamed Model B.R.1 for Bentley Rotary 1, the larger B.R.2 rotary aircraft engine powered a variety of World War I aircraft, including, among others, the: Sopwith F.1 Camel and 7F.1 Snipe; Nieuport B.N.1; and Vickers F.B.26A Vampire II. Humber Ltd., one of five British companies that manufactured this model during World War I, built this Bentley B.R.2 artifact.
The oldest surviving Pitts Special, Little Stinker was the second aircraft constructed by Curtis Pitts. Pitts introduced the S-1 in 1945, the first of a famous line that dominated aerobatic competition throughout the 1960s and 1970s because of their small size, light weight, short wingspan, and extreme agility. Subsequent models still fly in all aerobatic categories and are standard aircraft for advanced aerobatic training.
Betty Skelton bought this airplane in 1948, and with it she won the 1949 and '50 International Feminine Aerobatic Championships. Her impressive flying skill and public relations ability heightened awareness of both aerobatics and the Pitts design. Skelton sold Little Stinker in 1951, but she and her husband later reacquired it and donated it to the Smithsonian. A volunteer crew restored it from 1996 to 2001.
Like the Wright brothers, who followed, John Stringfellow and his associate William Henson are an important link to early aeronautical researchers. At an exposition in 1868 in London's Crystal Palace, where it powered a triplane model along a cable, the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain awarded a prize of £100 to Stringfellow’s engine as the lightest in proportion to its power, producing 0.75 kW (one horsepower) for the weight of 5.9 kg (13 pounds).
In 1889, Smithsonian Secretary Samuel P. Langley purchased the engine, along with a "car" designed to carry an engine and a pair of propellers, for £25. Langley held on to the engine briefly, sending it to L.D. Copeland of Smithville, N.J., for experimental work. Upon return of the engine to Langley, he turned it over to the museum section of the Smithsonian for public display, also in 1889.
In 1996 NASA selected Lockheed Martin to build and fly the X-33 test vehicle to demonstrate advanced technologies for a new reusable launch vehicle to succeed the Space Shuttle. VentureStar was Lockheed's name for this future spaceplane concept. The Lockheed Skunk Works designed a lifting body shape with aerospike rocket engines and a metallic thermal protection system as a single-stage-to-orbit vehicle. The program was a joint NASA-industry effort to develop a new commercial launch vehicle, and the model bears decals of all the participating companies. NASA cancelled the project in 2001 before any test flights were carried out after some technical problems proved too difficult to solve. This model is a relic of an ambitious but failed attempt to validate a new spaceplane concept.
NASA transferred the model to the Museum in 2006.
This valve was made by the American rocket pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard (1882-1945) to protect his liquid oxygen tanks from bursting due to too much pressure caused by evaporation of the very cold liquid. The valve dates to the 1930's when Goddard conducted his experiments at Roswell, New Mexico.
Mrs. Robert H. Goddard donated this object to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 as part of a large collection of artifacts from her husband.
The most successful aircraft in air racing history, Nemesis dominated its competition, winning 47 of its 50 contests from 1991 until its retirement in 1999. Flown by pilot and designer Jon Sharp, it won nine consecutive Reno Gold National Championships and 16 world speed records for its class.
Nemesis was the International Formula One points champion every year from 1994 to 1998. In 1991 it won the George Owl Trophy for design excellence. In 1993, '96, and '98, it won the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale's Louis Blériot Medal for the greatest achievement in speed. In 1993, '94, '95, and '99, Nemesis won the Pulitzer Trophy for air racing speed records. The airplane is built of pressure-molded graphite epoxy foam core sandwich.
Astronauts Frank Borman and James Lovell were launched into orbit aboard this spacecraft, Gemini VII, on December 4, 1965. Their primary mission was to show that humans could live in weightlessness for 14 days, a record that would stand until 1970. Gemini VII also served as the target vehicle for Gemini VI-A, piloted by Walter Schirra and Thomas Stafford, who carried out the world's first space rendezvous on December 15. These two achievements were critical steps on the road to the Apollo Moon landing.
This module is the only part of Gemini that returned to earth. Behind the heat shield was an adapter section containing propellants for the maneuvering thrusters, fuel cells for electric power, and retrorockets. It was jettisoned before reentry. The nose section was discarded during parachute deployment. In 1968 the National Aeronautics and Space Administration gave Gemini VII to the Smithsonian.
This is a gas gain ion chamber ionization detector similar to those that flew in Aerobee rockets in the late 1950's to early 1960's. The lithium fluoride window in this detector was designed to be transparent to radiation in the range from 1050 to 1300 Angstroms. The charges generated by the impact of the photons on the interior gas then traveled to the oppositely charged electrode. Additional collisions of the ions and electrons with filling gas on their way to the electrodes generated more charges and in effect amplified the signal.
This artifact is part of a collection of high energy detectors from the Naval Research Laboratory (see A19880001000-19880017000). It was transferred to NASM in 1987 and is currently stored at the Garber facility.
Ettore Bugatti designed the prototype of this engine in France during World War I. The U.S. Government's Bolling Commission, established to acquire European military aeronautical technology that could be built in America, purchased it because of its high performance potential and ability to mount a 37 mm cannon that could fire through the propeller hub. Duesenberg Motors was selected to produce the engine.
Engineer Charles B. King and his team made significant changes to correct technical problems and make the engine suitable for U.S. production methods. Renamed the King-Bugatti, it passed its 50-hour military test in October 1918. Production was just beginning when the war ended. Duesenberg manufactured about 40 King-Bugattis by early 1919. None are known to have powered a U.S. aircraft.
This main bus ammeter measured the current from the batteries like those used in Gemini 3, IV, and VI. Located on the Gemini pilot's panel, the No. 1 scale displayed main batteries 1 and 2 and the No. 2 scale displayed main batteries 3 and 4. Fuel cells replaced batteries on Gemini V and VII through XII. This ammeter did not fly in space.
Weston Instruments made the artifact and NASA transferred it to NASM in 1972.
The Wright vertical four-cylinder engine was designed by Orville Wright in 1906. These engines, of which more were built than any other Wright Brothers' engine model, were produced until approximately 1912. They were used during the U.S. Army and European demonstrations, which were crucial to the success of the Wright brothers and their airplanes. An engine of this type powered the Vin Fiz, the first U.S. transcontinental aircraft, and Wright Model B aircraft. A Wright B1 was the U.S. Navy’s second aircraft, which was first flown by Orville Wright on July 15, 1911, and later converted to a “hydroaeroplane.”
This particular engine was a keepsake of Orville Wright for many years. Wright gave the engine to his close and trusted friend, Jim Jacobs, who had been a mechanic with the original Wright Company. In 1948, the engine was donated to the Smithsonian Institution by Jacobs' wife, Ruth.
This Zeiss lens was used on the Zeiss Ikon camera Ed White used during his spacewalk on Gemini IV. The flown camera, considered U.S. Air Force property at the time of the flight, is in the collection of the National Museum of the United States Air Force in Dayton, Ohio. The camera and lens, attached to White's hand-held maneuvering unit when he performed the first spacewalk by an American, captured images looking back towards the spacecraft and mission commander James McDivitt.
This lens, supplied by NASA for the Gemini IV flight, was transferred to the Museum in 1989.
In 1932, the Army contracted with Continental for development of a cylinder with high specific power. Using the resulting Hyper No. 1 cylinder, the Air Corps instructed Continental in 1934 to develop what became the horizontally opposed O-1430 to be buried in the wings of large aircraft to improve streamlining for higher speed. However, by this time, the Air Corps decided that 746 kW (1,000 hp) engines were obsolete for bombers, and that fighter wings were too thin for a submerged installation.
By 1939, the Air Corps decided that an inverted vee was needed for improved visibility, and instructed Continental to drop the 0-1430 and begin work on the inverted I-1430. Following development problems, it was decided in 1943 that the engine could not possibly be used in the war, and only eight engines were built for experimental use. This Continental I-1430-11 was test flown in a modified Lockheed P-38 testbed aircraft.
A direct-drive, liquid-cooled, supercharged, two-stroke cycle engine, this General Motors engine was a very unusual design incorporating four cylinder blocks, each containing two cylinder bores with a common combustion chamber. At least one application was a small radio controlled target aircraft, and it also powered an Oldsmobile Eight automobile. Flight testing by famed racing and test pilot Tony LeVier successfully continued through 1940 as high as 7.6 km (25,000 ft.) in a Cessna Airmaster C-165, but other pressing war priorities led to termination of the project.
A 1942 engineering report written by GM's Research Laboratories, led at the time by its highly regarded director Charles F. Kettering, stated that the engine had excellent power/displacement and power/weight ratios, low fuel consumption, and very low vibration characteristics.
Removed from the Cessna in June 1946, the aircraft was later refurbished and flown again.
The Curtiss N-9H was a seaplane version of the famous Curtiss JN-4D trainer used by the U.S. Air Service during the First World War. To make the conversion, a single large central pontoon was mounted below the fuselage, with a small float fitted under each wingtip. These changes required a 10-foot increase in wingspan to compensate for the additional weight.
During the war, 2,500 Navy pilots were trained on the N-9H. In addition to training a generation of Navy pilots, the N-9H was used to develop tactics for ship-borne aircraft operations in 1916 and 1917, using catapults mounted on armored cruisers. After the war, the airplane was again employed to successfully demonstrate a compressed air turntable catapult. In July 1917, several N-9Hs were acquired by the Sperry Gyroscope Company and were used as test vehicles for aerial torpedo experiments conducted for the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. The N-9H was withdrawn from the U.S. Navy inventory in 1927 after ten years of exemplary service.
The Sopwith Camel is among the most significant and famous of all WWI aircraft. Camels downed 1,294 enemy aircraft, more than any other Allied fighter in WWI. The cowling over the two Vickers machine guns ahead of the cockpit created a distinctive “hump,” making the name Camel a natural choice, although it was never an official military designation.
Unlike the earlier Sopwith Pup and Sopwith Triplane, which were docile to fly and well-liked by pilots, the Camel was unstable, requiring constant input from the pilot. The gyroscopic effects of its powerful rotary engine made it dangerous for novice pilots, and almost as many were killed in accidents as died in combat. But its instability also contributed to it being agile and maneuverable, and once its tricky characteristics were mastered, the Camel was a superior fighting airplane.
The Camel entered operational service in July 1917 and remained a front-line fighter until the end of the war, with approximately 5,490 built. This example, B6291, served with No. 10 Squadron of the Royal Naval Air Service.
The Grumman G-164 Ag-Cat is the first aircraft specifically designed by a major aircraft company for agricultural aviation, the aerial application of chemical, fertilizer and seed, and it is one of the most successful with nearly 2,700 built. After consulting with agricultural pilots, Grumman introduced the Ag-Cat in 1957. The Ag-Cat handles the rigors of very low altitude, high "g force" agricultural application maneuvers with rugged construction, a low stall speed and good visibility.
This Grumman G-164 Ag-Cat, N332Y (serial number 207), rolled off the factory line on May 2, 1963, and, in 1974, became a G-164A Super Ag-Cat, with the change to a 600 hp engine and a 300 gallon hopper. Although it has 12,778 flight hours applying seed, fertilizer, pesticides and herbicides to nearly any crop grown in the United States, all chemical residues have been removed. In 2008, many radial and turbine powered Ag-Cats are still in use.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
This plaque was presented to Dr. Sally K. Ride by the National Collegeiate Athletic Association in 1998. The Silver Anniversary Award annually recognizes distinguished individuals on the 25th anniversary of the conclusion of their college athletics careers. As an undergraduate at Swarthmore and Stanford, Ride was a nationally ranked tennis player and briefly considered a professional career in the sport.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the plaque to the Museum in 2013.
Bigelow Aerospace is one of several commercial ventures entering the human spaceflight arena in the early 2000s. Their signature concept, represented by this model, is inflatable modules that can be assembled to form a space station. These compact, lighter-weight-than-rigid-metal modules can be launched without a crew and automatically expanded to full size, with onboard air, in orbit, to serve as living quarters and space laboratories. Two test modules were placed in orbit and successfully inflated in 2006 and 2007. As the commercial launch vehicle and crew transport vehicle entrepreneurial efforts mature, Bigelow plans to develop a multi-module space station complex as depicted in this model provided to the Museum in 2009.
This is a Descent Engine designed by Space Technology Laboratories as used on the Project Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LM) to land on the Moon. The engine could be throttled between 1,000 and 10,000 pounds of thrust and was also the first gimballed and throttable rocket engine used on a spacecraft.
The engine shown here is an early developmental model dating to 1966. During the Apollo lunar missions from 1969-1972, there were no problems with the Descent Engine, although on the Apollo 13 mission, no Moon landing was made and the Descent Engine served another purpose, that of taking the craft out of lunar orbit and back home. The engine was donated to the Smithsonian in 1972 by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.
This Key to the City of Los Angeles was presented to Dr. Sally K. Ride in October 1984 by Mayor Tom Bradley. During the ceremony, Bradley said, "Sally Ride represents more than just the first woman in space, she is a symbol for young girls and woman all over the world that here in America this kind of opportunity is possible." Ride was born and raised in Los Angeles, and in response to recieving the award she said, "I have received quite a few keys to quite a few cities that I am not quite familiar with so it is a real honor to get the key to the city I still consider home."
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984.

The FB series of U.S. Navy fighters began with the Boeing Model 15 prototype in 1923. The Army procured several examples of the promising design, which it designated the PW-9. The Navy closely followed the Army's testing of the aircraft and added an order for 14 to an Army contract in late 1924. The Navy designated their airplane the FB 1. The FB-2, FB-3, and FB-4 were simply FB-1s modified to test different components.
The major production model of the series was the FB-5, which differed considerably from earlier models. Visibility and control problems were corrected by altering the wing stagger and installing a balanced rudder, along with other changes. The FB-5 displayed here served aboard the U.S.S. Langley and Saratoga. It was assigned to Marine Fighter Squadron VF-6M for several months in 1930.
"Our messenger of peace and goodwill has broken down another barrier of time and space." So spoke President Calvin Coolidge about Charles A. Lindbergh’s extraordinary solo transatlantic flight in 1927. Not until the Apollo 11 moon landing in 1969 was the entire world again as enthusiastic about an aviation event as it was when Lindbergh landed his little Ryan monoplane in Paris.
In 1922, after a year and a half at the University of Wisconsin, Lindbergh left to study aeronautics with the Nebraska Aircraft Corporation. He was a "barnstormer" until 1924, when he enrolled as a flying cadet in the Army Air Service. He won his reserve commission and began serving as a civilian airmail pilot, flying the route between St. Louis and Chicago.
Early in 1927 he obtained the backing of several St. Louis men to compete for the $25,000 prize offered by Raymond Orteig in 1919 for the first nonstop flight between New York City and Paris. In February of that year Lindbergh placed an order with Ryan Airlines in San Diego for an aircraft with specifications necessary to make the flight.
Development began based on a standard Ryan M-2, with Donald A. Hall as principal designer. Certain modifications to the basic high-wing, strut-braced monoplane design had to be made because of the nature of the flight. The wingspan was increased by 10 feet and the structural members of the fuselage and wing cellule were redesigned to accommodate the greater fuel load. Plywood was fitted along the leading edge of the wings. The fuselage design followed that of a standard M-2 except that it was lengthened 2 feet. The cockpit was moved further to the rear for safety and the engine was moved forward for balance, thus permitting the fuel tank to be installed at the center of gravity. The pilot could see forward only by means of a periscope or by turning the aircraft to look out of a side window. A Wright Whirlwind J-5C engine supplied the power.
Late in April 1927 the work on the aircraft was completed. It was painted silver and carried registration number N-X-21 1, which, with all other lettering on the plane, was painted in black. Lindbergh made several test flights, and then flew the aircraft from San Diego to New York on May 10—12, making only one stop, at St. Louis. His flight time of 21 hours, 40 minutes set a new transcontinental record.
After waiting several days in New York for favorable weather, Lindbergh took off for Paris alone, on the morning of May 20, 1927. Thirty-three hours, 30 minutes, and 3,610 miles later he landed safely at Le Bourget Field, near Paris, where he was greeted by a wildly enthusiastic crowd of 100,000.
Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis returned to the United States aboard the U.S.S. Memphis on June 11. He received tumultuous welcomes in Washington, D.C. and New York City. From July 20 until October 23 of that year he took the famous plane on a tour of the United States. Then, on December 13, he and the Spirit of St. Louis flew nonstop from Washington to Mexico City; through Central America, Colombia, Venezuela, Puerto Rico; and nonstop from Havana to St. Louis. Beginning in Mexico City, flags of the countries he visited were painted on both sides of the cowling.
On April 30, 1928, the Spirit of St. Louis made its final flight—from St. Louis to Washington, D.C where Lindbergh presented the aircraft to the Smithsonian Institution.
During World War II many materials were unavailable to the public because of government rationing. This blouse is an inovative example of a woman repurposing the silk escape maps that her husband used while flying combat in Europe.
This is a centrifugal pump designed and made by U.S. rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard for forcing the propellants into the combustion chamber of a rocket motor. Most likely its dates from ca. 1938-1941, when he worked at his test site at Roswell, New Mexico, on his so-called P-Series, or pump series of rocket motors. The object was donated to the Smithsonian by the Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics in 1985.
The Union Gas Engine Company (later the Union Diesel Engine Company) of Oakland, California designed this aircraft engine in 1915. In 1917, it was the first to pass the U.S. government 50-hour test. Union engines were built primarily for use in lighter-than-air craft, and an engine of this type powered the trans-Atlantic trial and record flight of the U.S. Navy’s Airship C-5 in 1919.
This is the Lunar Module Ascent Engine used to lift up the ascent portion of the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) after the completion of a lunar landing mission for Project Apollo. The ascent portion of the LEM, carrying the Apollo two astronauts, then docked with the Command Module (CM) orbiting the Moon and flown by the CM Commander.
The Ascent Engine engine produced 3,500 pounds of thrust and was built by the Bell Aerosystems Company. The engine was used successfully in all operational Apollo lunar missions between 1969 and 1972, except for Apollo 13 which did not reach the Moon. This engine was donated to the Smithsonian in 1972 by the Grumman Aerospace Co.
The P-61 Black Widow was the first U.S. aircraft designed to locate and destroy enemy aircraft at night and in bad weather, a feat made possible by the use of on-board radar. The prototype first flew in 1942. P-61 combat operations began just after D-Day, June 6, 1944, when Black Widows flew deep into German airspace, bombing and strafing trains and road traffic. Operations in the Pacific began at about the same time. By the end of World War II, Black Widows had seen combat in every theater and had destroyed 127 enemy aircraft and 18 German V-1 buzz bombs.
The Museum’s Black Widow, a P-61C-1-NO, was delivered to the Army Air Forces in July 1945. It participated in cold-weather tests, high-altitude drop tests, and in the National Thunderstorm Project, for which the top turret was removed to make room for thunderstorm monitoring equipment.
On June 12, 1979, the Gossamer Albatross, with Bryan Allen as pilot, became the first human-powered aircraft to fly across the English Channel. The flight lasted 2 hours and 49 minutes and covered 36.2 kilometers (22.5 miles) between Folkestone, England, and Cap Gris Nez, France. For this accomplishment, the Albatross team won their second Kremer Prize for human-powered aircraft.
Designed by Dr. Paul MacCready and his team of engineers from AeroVironment, the Albatross was similar to the Gossamer Condor, which was the first successful human-powered aircraft. The Albatross was built mostly of carbon fiber tubing and covered with clear Mylar. Unlike the Condor, it was designed to be easily disassembled for shipping.
Over 10,000 Stearman trainers were built by Boeing's Wichita Division, which had purchased the Stearman Company in the late 1930s. These Kaydets, along with Fairchilds and Ryans, served as the backbone of U.S. Army and Navy primary training in World War II. The original U.S. Army Kaydet was the PT-13 with a 220 Lycoming R-680 engine. The only complete standardization of an Army and Navy production design aircraft during World War II was achieved with the Boeing-Stearman E-75, which served the Army as the PT-13D and the Navy as the N2S-5.
This Kaydet was accepted by the Navy on December 7, 1943, exactly two years after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The airplane was flown to the Ottumwa, Iowa, Naval Air Station, where it was used to train naval aviation cadets until 1946.
U.S. Army Air Corps balloonist Capt. Hawthorne Gray launched from Scott Field, Illinois, on November 4, 1927, on his third attempt to explore conditions and test equipment that would enable air crews to survive and function at altitudes of over 40,000 feet.
The balloon was found in a tree near Sparta, Tennessee, the next day, with Gray's lifeless body still in the basket. He had apparently become confused, parachuting a full bottle of oxygen to earth in an effort to climb even higher. He died from lack of oxygen. "His courage," suggested the citation of his posthumous Distinguished Flying Cross. "was greater than his supply of oxygen."
This cradle secured Baker, a female squirrel monkey, in her biocapsule during the first flight to recover a primate from space. On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Baker and Able (a female rhesus monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The cradle was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960.
The SS-20, known as the "Pioneer" in Russian, is a two-stage, solid propellant missile with three multiple targetable reentry warheads. The missile is almost 16.5 meters tall.
The exterior of the first stage is yellow fiberglass with numbers and Cyrillic letters printed along the circumference. The letters and numbers are used as guides in the manufacturing process when the solid fuel is covered with fiberglass. Two thirds of the way up the missile are the letters "CCCP" and a yellow five-point star.
The second stage has similar markings. The reentry vehicle consists of three warheads. The predominant color of the missile is green. Along the base of the missile are white fan stabilizers that assist in guidance.
The Votkinsk Machine Building Plant, USSR, constructed the missile for the exhibition at the National Air and Space Museum. Exhibition of this missile complies with the Intermediate Nuclear Forces agreement between the US and USSR that provided for the preservation of fifteen SS-20 and Pershing II missiles to commemorate the first international agreement to ban an entire class of nuclear arms exhibition. It does not contain fuel or any live components. The Ministry of Defense of the USSR donated the missile to the Smithsonian.
Macready and Kelly used these basic instruments to fly the
T-2 by dead reckoning-"seat of the pants" flying-as they hugged the terrain on their way to San Diego.
The Beechcraft King Air is the world's most popular turboprop aircraft. Beech Aircraft developed the King Air in 1964 as a compromise between piston-engine and jet aircraft; it could fly farther and higher than piston-engine aircraft yet land on the short runways of most small airports. The design remains the primary business aircraft for small to mid-size companies and part of the flight inventories of larger corporations.
Rather than investing in new and expensive technology, Beech built an improved and marketable business aircraft from its existing production line. The aircraft displayed here, LJ-34, began as a Queen Air that was upgraded with Pratt and Whitney PT6A-6 turboprop engines, a design that soon became the C-90. Several companies operated it for a total of more than 7,000 hours of service.
On September 9, 1959, NASA launched this unoccupied Mercury spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a suborbital flight that lasted 13 minutes. Its launch was the second in the Mercury program and the first using an Atlas booster. The flight helped NASA evaluate the booster, the new ablative heat shield, the capsule's flight dynamics and aerodynamic shape, and spacecraft recovery systems and procedures.
The heavily instrumented "Big Joe" was the most massive American spacecraft launched up to that time. It weighed about as much as a manned version would, and its success paved the way for the beginning of manned Mercury launches in 1961.
This World War I engine, built by Germany’s Maybach, was of the type that powered the Zeppelin, Schutte-Lanz, and Parseval airships or airplanes such as the Rumpler C4 and C5. Without measurements of the artifact it is not possible to determine if it was the water-cooled, six-cylinder, in-line design rated at 149 kW (200 shp) that powered the airships, or the derivative of this engine, known as the 224 kW (300 shp) Maybach, that powered the airplanes.
The artifact is heavily damaged. It is probable that it was removed from a downed airship for technical analysis. This engine was part of a collection of foreign power plants that was assembled by the U.S. Army Air Corps, Materiel Division at McCook Field in Dayton, Ohio
The German Pfalz D.XII appeared on the western front in the summer of 1918. It climbed satisfactorily and its performance in level flight was comparable to that of the famous Fokker D.VII. But it could not turn as well and it was sluggish in combat. Despite these limitations, the Pfalz D.XII performed well enough to relieve the German Air Service of its shortage of competitive fighters late in the war. By the time of the Armistice, nearly 800 D.XIIs had been delivered to front-line service.
The wartime history of the NASM Pfalz D.XII is obscure. After the war, it came to the United States as part of Allied war reparations. It was later sold as war surplus, brought to Hollywood, and appeared in a number of World War I aviation films. Given the lack of information on this particular airplane's wartime history, and its well-documented and illustrious movie career, NASM decided to restore the Pfalz as it appeared in the 1930 Hollywood aviation classic, Dawn Patrol.
The fast and rugged Spad XIII was among the most successful fighters of World War I, in a class with the legendary Fokker D.VII and Sopwith Camel. It was flown by some of the most famous air heroes of the war, such as Guynemer, Fonck, Nungesser, Lufbery, Luke, and Rickenbacker. The aircraft was particularly noted for its robust construction and its ability to dive at high speed, features that made it one of the best dog-fighting airplanes of the war.
The Spad XIII was produced and deployed in great numbers. By the end of 1918, the parent company and eight other French manufactures had built 8,472 of the sturdy fighters. Almost every French fighter squadron was equipped with them by the end of the war, as well as the American units that were part of the American Expeditionary Force. Spads were also used by the British, the Italians, the Belgians, and the Russians.
Following its success as an automobile manufacturer, Rolls-Royce began design and development of aircraft engines at the request of the British Admiralty at the beginning of World War I. In June 1927, Rolls-Royce began designing a scaled-up version of its supercharged Kestrel to power large flying boats. Later known as the Buzzard, the prototype was completed in 1928 and installed experimentally in large aircraft, both flying boats and land planes. Rolls-Royce sold less than 50 production engines, 32 of them to the Japanese. Even though Rolls-Royce abandoned the Buzzard within a few years, the development work on it proved important; serving as the basis for the R engine, which won the Schneider Trophy in 1929 and 1931.
Designated V-2240-56, this engine was performance tested by the U.S. Navy Aeronautical Engine Laboratory in the early 1930s. The H.XIV model powered the Blackburn B.3, Handley Page H.P.46, Hawker Horsley, Short S.14 Sarafand R.6/28, and Vickers 207 M.1/30.
The launch vehicle engine annunciator is a display located on the Apollo command module's main display console (MDC). Part of the Caution and Warning Subsystem, which monitored critical parameters of most of the spacecraft operational systems, this display alerted the crewmembers to malfunctions of any of the launch vehicle engines or "out-of-tolerance" conditions when they occurred in any of the engines.
This display was flown on Apollo 16 and NASA transferred it to the Smithsonian in 1976.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines.

As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
This is a replica of a Pioneer satellite intended to orbit the moon. Pioneer 1 was launched on October 11, 1958, but the final velocity was insufficient to escape the earth's gravity. The resulting trajectory took the satellite to an altitude of 70,700 mi. During the flight, the spacecraft transmitted 43 hours of scientific data. It burned up upon reentry into the earth's atmosphere two days later. This replica was assembled in 1963 by the prime contractor, Space Technology Laboratories Inc (TRW) from original parts that failed to meet flight specifications. It was displayed at the Los Angeles Museum of Science until February 1964 and then donated to the Smithsonian Institution by TRW. It was displayed in the NASM Satellites gallery from 1976 to 1983, loaned to the Scottish Museum from May to December 1984, and then was part of a SI Traveling exhibition. It is now in display storage at the Hazy Center.
During the Apollo 11 mission, Magazine R was used inside the lunar module "Eagle" with an electric Hasselblad camera. The color images printed from this magazine include moments from inside the lunar module during undocking from the command module "Columbia" and continue through the crew's return to the spacecraft after their historic EVA to the lunar surface. No images from its film roll came from outside the lunar module. This magazine and the camera it attached to were modified with a silver metal exterior to repel the solar rays that could easily overheat and destroy this sensitive equipment on the lunar surface.
Hasselblad cameras and magazines, selected for their reliability and high quality, were used on all lunar missions. The magazines were easily switched out at any time, allowing crew members change between color and black and white film at a moments notice.
NASA transferred this film magazine to the Museum in 1970.
This model represents the final Space Shuttle design that emerged from NASA-industry studies in 1969-1972. This design was selected as the best combination of a reusable orbiter, a disposable external tank, and two recoverable solid rocket boosters after it became evident that a completely reusable system would be too large and too costly. The model depicts the orbiter Columbia and the Shuttle "stack" poised for launch on the mobile launch platform and crawler transporter. Rockwell International, Space Shuttle prime contractor, presented this model to the Museum shortly after the first mission in 1981.
The Pitcairn-Brewer Model F engine was developed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, during 1927 and 1928. This engine was designed by Captain Robert W. A. Brewer and sponsored by Harold F. Pitcairn. The objective was an engine that was more reliable and lighter than existing engines, specifically, a replacement for the Curtiss OX-5 that could power Pitcairn Aircraft, Inc. and other aircraft as well. The Pitcairn-Brewer engine was tested by the U.S. Navy Aeronautical Engine Laboratory and was flight tested on a Pitcairn PA-4 Fleetwing II.
While the engine was successful technically, Pitcairn could not find a manufacturer willing to produce it. The Wright Whirlwind J-5 engine was being marketed at the same time, and the Pitcairn-Brewer engine could not compete with it. This is the last remaining engine of three built.

This slide rule belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. Before pocket-sized electronic calculators became available in the 1970s, slide rules were used as an aid to complex mathematical operations. Ride used this device as a university student taking courses in physics and astrophysics.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 in the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger accident in 1986 and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987, titled “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space” but known popularly as the "Ride Report."
After she left NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego, where she also served as the director of the California Space Institute. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she founded to promote science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the slide rule to the Museum in 2013.
For over 30 years, the Pioneer 10 spacecraft sent photographs and scientific information back to Earth. Launched March 2, 1972, it reached speeds of 52,100 kilometers (32,400 miles) per hour on its flight to Jupiter, making it one of the fastest human-made objects ever. After completing an investigation of Jupiter, Pioneer 10 continued on to the outer regions of the solar system, studying solar wind and cosmic rays.
Having gone further into space than any other object sent from Earth, Pioneer's last weak signal was received on January 22, 2003, from approximately 12.2 billion kilometers (7.6 billion miles) from Earth. NASA engineers reported that Pioneer 10's radioisotope power source had degraded and was not likely to allow future transmissions.
As it drifts into interstellar space, Pioneer 10 will continue to carry a plaque designed to inform intelligent life that may find it about the spacecraft and its origins. The prototype spacecraft displayed here was constructed for NASA by TRW, Inc.
Originally the engine building subsidiary of the German Zeppelin Company (Luftschiffbau Zeppelin G.m.b.H.), Maybach Motorenbau G.m.b.H. of Friedrichshafen possibly became better known by its later luxury automobiles. Maybach began manufacturing engines in 1909, following a characteristic German six-cylinder, water cooled, vertical design. These powered the World War I Zeppelin, Schutte-Lanz, and Parseval airships or airplanes such as the Rumpler C4 and C5.
Development of the Maybach Model Mb Iv began in 1916. It had a high compression ratio for high-altitude flying, and powered such aircraft as the Rumple Ru C VI and C VII long-distance reconnaissance airplanes. The Treaty of Versailles curtailed the company’s activities following the war.
Schoolteacher John Monnett designed the Moni (mo-nee) during the early 1980s, and then coined the term 'air recreation vehicle' to describe this airplane. Monnett's design almost captured all the merits that so many leisure pilots longed to find in one aircraft. The Moni looked great just sitting on the ramp. It performed well, and someone reasonably handy with average shop tools could construct one in their own garage. The design had much going for it, but like so many homebuilt aircraft before and since, a few key engineering lapses in the design, plus problems with the engine and propeller, relegated the Moni to the category of homebuilt aircraft that promise much in design but fail to deliver. Harold C. Weston generously donated his Moni to the National Air and Space Museum in April 1992. Weston built the airplane himself and flew it more than 40 hours.
In 1930, C. Gilbert Taylor of the Taylor Aircraft Company designed the E-2 Cub as a small, low cost, light general aviation aircraft. The E-2 was the predecessor of the Piper J-3 Cub which became one of the most popular light aircraft of all time and served in the military during World War II as the L-4. Like the J-3 Cub, it used the Continental A-40 Engine. Unlike many of the tradtional wood models in the collection, this model was constructed of fiberglas, resin, aluminum, and plexiglas by Mike Bortscheller.
In 1934 the Naval Aircraft Factory in Philadelphia was tasked to manufacture a new primary trainer for the U.S. Navy. Following successful tests, this little biplane trainer was built in both land and seaplane versions. The Navy initially ordered 179 N3N-1 models, and the factory began producing more than 800 N3N-3 models in 1938. U.S. Navy primary flight training schools used N3Ns extensively throughout World War II. A few of the seaplane version were retained for primary training at the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1961 they became the last biplanes retired from U.S. military service.
This N3N-3 was transferred from Cherry Point to Annapolis in 1946, where it served as a seaplane trainer. It was restored and displayed at the Naval Academy Museum before being transferred here.
The Japanese conglomerate Hitachi manufactured aircraft engines from about 1929 until the end of World War II, with a concentration on low-power seven and nine cylinder radials and inverted inline fours. The Hitachi Aircraft Company was formed in 1939 to take over the aircraft and aero-engine branches of the Tokyo Gasu Denki K.K. or Tokyo Gas & Electric Co., Ltd. Many, if not most, Japanese military trainers were powered by Hitachi copies of German designed Hirth air-cooled inline engines.
The Hitachi Hatsukaze powered the Kyushu K9W1 (Allied Code Name Cypress) Navy Type 2 Primary Trainer Model 11, and the similar Army version Kokusai Ki-86, Type 4 Primary Trainer aircraft. The engine was a derivative, licensed copy of the Hirth HM-504A, which powered the Bucker Bu 131 Jungmann aircraft. There were 541 Hatsukaze engines built during World War II between 1941 and 1943.
The classic Beechcraft Bonanza was introduced in 1947 and is still built today by Textron Aviation. The four-place aircraft sported all-metal construction and retractable landing gear for the sophisticated or executive pilot. Initially designed with the distinctive butterfly or V tail--a conventional tail model was offered too--it was the basis for later Beech aircraft.
On March 7-8, 1949, William P. Odom set a light-plane, nonstop distance record from Honolulu, Hawaii, to Teterboro, New Jersey, in the Waikiki Beech (see markings on left side), the fourth Bonanza built. Congressman Peter F. Mack flew the renamed Friendship Flame on a goodwill world flight from October 7, 1951 to January 27, 1952 (see markings on right side).
A medical kit of the type carried on each of the World Cruisers.
During the Apollo 11 mission, Magazine S was used to record some of the most memorable images from the mission while astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin explored the lunar surface. The color images printed from this magazine include moments from inside the lunar module immediately prior to Armstrong leaving the spacecraft, Armstrong's first photograph after taking his historic first steps, iconic images of Buzz Aldrin next to the American flag and the "Moonman" image of Aldrin with Armstrong reflected in his visor, and "bootprint" images. This magazine and the camera it attached to were modified with a silver metal exterior to repel the solar rays that could easily overheat and destroy this sensitive equipment on the lunar surface.
Hasselblad cameras and magazines, selected for their reliability and high quality, were used on all lunar missions. The magazines were easily switched out at any time, allowing crew members change between color and black and white film at a moments notice.
NASA transferred this film magazine to the Museum in 1970.
This Apollo program simulator demonstrates the view from inside the Lunar Module (LM) during descent to the surface of the Moon. In each lunar landing mission, two astronauts stood inside a LM as they controled the gradual descent of the spacecraft. Sixteen rockets situated around the outer structure of the LM controlled the attitude of the craft. These rockets could be fired automatically by mechanical sensors or by the astronauts' inclinations. Landing on the Moon is unlike landing on Earth. The Moon's atmosphere is extremely thin, which restricted the possibility of a diagonal glide-type landing. Instead, the astronauts landed vertically. The retro-rocket of the descent engine assured a gradual touchdown.
Transferred to the National Air and Space Museum from Grumman Aerospace, the manufacturer, in 1975.
In 1909, the G.H. Curtiss Manufacturing Company delivered the firm's first airplane, a pusher design with elevators in the front, called the Golden Flyer, to the New York Aeronautical Society. In 1911, Curtiss began to concentrate on the military market, selling three airplanes to the U.S. Navy. Curtiss continued the evolution of the pusher design with the development of the D-II (the Golden Flyer was considered the Model D) and the D-III, to which a second set of elevators were added to the rear in place of the fixed horizontal stabilizer formerly used on the D and D-II models.
The Curtiss D-III Headless Pusher resulted from an accident incurred by noted exhibition pilot, Lincoln Beachey. While flying in a competition with a standard Curtiss D-III, Beachey hit a fence upon landing and destroyed the front elevator. Rather than drop out, Beachey continued to fly without the front elevator control and found that the aircraft performed better than before. Navy pilots had independently realized that stability was enhanced without the forward elevator and they removed them from their airplanes. Curtiss concurred with the results and began producing the 1912 Model D Headless Pusher as a new offering.
Amron Kreider and Lewis Reisner of Hagerstown, Maryland, built the Kreider-Reisner C-4C Challenger, a light and efficient biplane, as a replacement for aging Curtiss Jennys and Standards. Beginning in 1926, Kreider-Reisner built a series of three-place, open-cockpit aircraft that flew exceptionally well. The addition of a Wright J-6 engine made the design especially reliable.
In April 1929, Kreider-Reisner became a subsidiary of the Fairchild Airplane Manufacturing Company, which redesignated the C-4C Challenger line as the Fairchild KR-34. C-4s and KR-34s flew as sport aircraft, air taxis, and press planes, and in the 1929 National Air Tour. This C-4C was built during the parent company transition period and carries the Challenger designation. It flew with many owners and is restored to reflect its association with North Penn Airways.
When Skylab was launched in May 1973, one of the solar arrays ripped off during launch and the other became jammed under a metal strap. The crew arrived at Skylab 11 days later, ready to free and extend the stuck solar array so it could produce electrical power for the space station. NASA had quickly gathered some tools for the astronauts to use to solve the unexpected problem.
This cable cutter is a standard linesman's tool that was slightly modified for the task in space. It was probably used before the crew's launch to develop and practice procedures for cutting the metal strap to release the jammed solar array. The first Skylab crew carried such a cable cutter into orbit and used it successfully during an extravehicular activity or "spacewalk" to make the repair.
Transferred from NASA to the Museum in 1973.
In 1930, Continental began development of air-cooled horizontally opposed engines for low-powered aircraft. For example, the Continental A-40 made the classic Piper Cub possible. In 1980, Continental began evaluation of the liquid-cooled concept for future general aviation aircraft, and, in 1984, the engine was chosen for the Voyager aircraft.
The advanced design incorporated a lightweight, liquid-cooled cylinder, permitting combustion chamber improvements and minimizing fuel consumption by reducing cooling drag and wear characteristics, as well as providing longer life and time-between-overhaul. The design also allowed the high altitude capability necessary for the Voyager aircraft.
The exhibited Voyager-200 engine is an exact duplicate of the rear engine installed in the aircraft. The fuel efficiency of this power plant was one of the key elements that made Voyager's nonstop, unrefueled round-the-world flight possible. Except for a 4-minute interval near the end of the flight when the fuel flow was interrupted, the engine ran continuously during Voyager's 9-day flight in late-1986.
George Bogardus flew the Little Gee Bee from Oregon to Washington, D. C., in 1947, 1949, and 1951. These three flights helped to convince officials in the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Board that amateurs could design and build light aircraft that were safe, reliable, and capable of practical cross-country flights. The CAA enacted legislation in 1952 that for the first time sanctioned the registration and operation of amateur-built aircraft. Later that year, Paul Poberezny founded the Experimental Aircraft Association, which has grown into a worldwide organization with more than 170,000 members.
Little Gee Bee was built before World War II. With financial support from Lee Eyerly of Salem, Oregon, Tom Story of Portland designed and built an aircraft in 1938 patterned on Leslie Long's Low Wing Longster. Story's airplane took the nickname Wimpy but when George Bogardus acquired it after the war, he renamed it Little Gee Bee.
Flown by R. A. "Bob" Hoover for 20 years, N500RA is the most recognized Shrike Commander in the world. Hoover began flying in 1937, flew 58 missions in World War II, and was an outstanding military and civilian test pilot. He set altitude and speed records in several North American and Rockwell aircraft and performed at air shows in the Shrike, P-51 Mustang, T-39, Aero Commander, and Sabreliner.
The Shrike Commander, a descendent of the 1948 Aero Commander L-3805, is a twin-engine, seven-place, unpressurized business aircraft. Hoover purchased his Shrike in 1979 and, with his extraordinary test pilot and fighter pilot skills, brought this simple business aircraft design to international acclaim. In it he performed his signature deadstick (no engine) routine of loop, roll, 180-degree turn, landing, and taxi to air show center.
World War I
Introduced in 1930, the Northrop Alpha represents a transitional air transport design, a blend of old and new aircraft technology. The Alpha could enclose six passengers in a snug, comfortable cabin, but the pilot remained exposed to the elements. The aircraft was all metal and streamlined, but had fixed landing gear and only one engine.
Designed by John K. "Jack" Northrop, the Alpha was a great step forward in metal aircraft. Many of its features, particularly the multicellular wing design, were later used in the Douglas DC-2 and DC-3. Although more powerful twin-engine aircraft rendered the Alpha obsolete for passenger service, it continued to serve as a fast express cargo plane.
This aircraft was restored by volunteers from Trans World Airlines.
The Lark was an early U.S. Navy surface-to-air, liquid-propellant, rocket-propelled missile built by the Consolidated-Vultee Aircraft Corporation, and was usually launched from the decks of ships with the help of solid propellant boosters. It carried a 100-pound warhead and had a range of about 38 miles.
The design of the Lark began in 1944, but it was not developed in time for use in World War II. It was used extensively from 1946-1950 as a test missile, providing valuable experience to U.S. military personnel in the handling and deployment of missiles. Some flights were made at sea. The Lark was also the first U.S. surface-to-air missile ever to intercept a moving air target. This object was donated to the Smithsonian in 1971 by the U.S. Navy.
The Model 17, the first aircraft produced by the new Beech Aircraft Company of Wichita, Kansas, was a gamble for president Walter Beech and vice-president Ted Wells who was chief designer of the aircraft. Produced during the depths of the Great Depression, this expensive aircraft was designed as a high-speed, comfortable business airplane. The gamble was successful with 781 Beech 17s produced in eight different series. The aircraft was technologically advanced for its time, and the negative staggered wing arrangement, which improved the pilot's visibility from the aircraft and the airplane's gentle stall characteristics, also contributed to the design's classic beauty.
The Beechcraft Staggerwing in the National Air and Space Museum, serial number 93, was manufactured on July 3, 1936, and registered as NC15840. It was a Model C17B powered with a 285-hp Jacobs L-5M engine. The original owner of the aircraft was E.E. Aldrin (father of astronaut Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin), who worked for Standard Oil Development Company in New York City. With a list price of $10,260, the aircraft was equipped with numerous extras, including expensive instrumentation, electrical bonding, rear seat parachutes, a magneto-equipped engine, and a custom paint scheme, using the colors and logo of Standard Oil. From 1936 to 1980, NC 15840 had 19 different owners including oil companies, charter and sightseeing businesses and the CAP, for coastal patrol duty during World War II. Desert Air Parts donated the aircraft in 1981.
Nicknamed Schwalbe (Swallow), the Messerschmitt Me 262 surpassed the performance of every other World War II fighter. Faster than the North American P-51 Mustang by 190 kilometers (120 miles) per hour, the Schwalbe restored to the faltering German Luftwaffe a short-lived qualitative superiority that it had enjoyed earlier in the war.
The Me 262 appeared in only relatively small numbers in the closing year of World War II. Messerschmitt factories produced 1,443 Me 262s, but only about 300 saw combat. The others were destroyed in training accidents or by Allied bombing attacks. The almost absolute Allied dominance of the air, and the development of fighter sweep tactics that offset the Me 262's performance advantage, ensured that the revolutionary fighter did not affect Allied air operations.
Only nine Me 262s survive in museums around the world. This one served with the famous Jagdgeschwader (Fighter Wing) 7. According to the tally on the fuselage, the Schwalbe's pilot, Heinz Arnold, scored 42 victories over Soviet piston-engine fighters and 7 over American bombers and fighters.
The original Wright brothers engines were vertical, four cylinder types. In 1910, needing a more powerful engine for the Gordon Bennett Cup Race, a single V-8 was built for this major event, apparently using much of the original four cylinder design concept. However, the aircraft and engine were wrecked before the race.
Faced with the problem of providing increased power for production aircraft in 1911, but insisting on their original objective of simplicity, the Wright’s compromise was a vertical six-cylinder engine. The engine incorporated a flexible (rubber band) drive on the flywheel which greatly reduced vibration and considerably extended the life of the chain drive that operated the propellers. The Wright 6-70 powered the Wright Model D aircraft in 1913, and the model designation was derived from the number of cylinders and the horsepower. Originating as a 45 kW (60 hp) model, further development led to a 60 kW (80 hp) version.
Following its success as an automobile manufacturer, Rolls-Royce, Ltd. began design and development of aircraft engines at the request of the British Admiralty at the beginning of World War I. The Rolls-Royce Condor was a large and very powerful engine developed at the end of the war in 1918 for use in long-range heavy bombers, principally for bombing Berlin, Germany. Design work was begun at the end of 1917 and retained the same cylinder construction of earlier types. A total of 327 Condors were recorded as having been built.
The Condor Mk IA (also referred to as the Condor II) was built in 1921. It succeeded the Mk I and incorporated several design changes, increasing the power and speed. Only 34 of these engines were built by Rolls-Royce at Derby. The Condor Mk IA powered the Beardmore BeRo.1 Inflexible, Fairey N.4 Atalanta, and the Hawker Horsley aircraft.
The PA-18 Super Cub was a strengthened PA-11, itself a modification of the original J-3 Cub. With only a few minor changes and a 150-horsepower engine, the PA-18 still looked like a Cub, although it came in several paint schemes and lacked the familiar bear logo on its tail. About 8,500 Super Cubs were built at Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and they proved popular as private and utility aircraft and as military trainers.
The Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) used this Super Cub in its uranium exploration program in the West during the 1950s. The rough and sometimes inaccessible terrain made an airborne survey a logical choice, and the AEC's fleet of 10 low, slow, and inexpensive Super Cubs maintained an enviable record of safety and reliability. A scintillation counter used to detect gamma radiation is in the rear of the airplane.
Designed and built by Lee Mahoney and his father, S. C. "Mickey" Mahoney, the Sorceress was the first sport biplane to exceed 322 kilometers (200 miles) per hour on a closed course, and it reached 394 kilometers (245 miles) per hour in level flight. The aircraft proved so successful that the rules governing its competition qualification were modified to such an extent that the Sorceress was forced into retirement.
Fitted with only a single 135-horsepower Lycoming O-290-D2 engine, this unique metal staggerwing biplane flew to many victories during its distinguished career in the 1970s. Noted air racing pilot Don Beck purchased the Sorceress in 1972 and flew it to many more wins. Beck gave the aircraft to the Museum in 1984.
In 1919, the H.& M. Farman Aeroplane Company of France produced the Farman Sport two-place sport and light commercial biplane. In 1922, C.T. Ludington and Wallace Kellett of Philadephia, Pennsylvania, formed the Ludington Exhibition Company as agents for Farman aircraft, and in 1923, they imported their first two Sports. Their pilot flew this aircraft, serial number 15, C-72, in the 1924 "On to Dayton Race," which included flying over the treacherous Allegheny Mountains.
After suffering severe damage in 1928, NC-72's airworthiness certificate was revoked and it languished for years in Pennsylvania and New Jersey until Ken Hyde of Warrenton, Virginia, restored it. C.T. Ludington himself identified the aircraft, allowing Hyde to reclaim the NC-72 registration. This is the last remaining Farman Sport.
This aircraft is the first X-35 ever built. It was originally the X-35A and was modified to include the lift-fan engine for testing of the STOVL concept. Among its many test records, this aircraft was the first in history to achieve a short takeoff, level supersonic dash, and vertical landing in a single flight. It is also the first aircraft to fly using a shaft-driven lift-fan propulsion system. The X-35B flight test program was one of the shortest, most effective in history, lasting from June 23, 2001 to August 6, 2001.
The lift-fan propulsion system is now displayed next to the X-35B at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center near Dulles Airport.
On July 7, 2006, the production model F-35 was officially named F-35 Lightning II by T. Michael Moseley, Chief of Staff USAF.
In the mid-1950s, Hiller constructed a series of innovative Flying Platforms for an Army-Navy program as a one-man flying vehicle that the pilot could control with minimal training. The pilot simply leaned in the desired direction and the platform would follow. The platforms, which utilized the aerodynamic advantages of the ducted fan, were incapable of tumbling, because if the pilot leaned over too far, the platform would pitch up and slow down.
The 1031-A-1 is the second of the Flying Platform prototypes and was the first to operate out of ground effect (aerodynamic cushion caused by thrust hitting the ground). The Army contracted for a larger, improved model - the VZ-1 - but the extra engines required for redundancy if the primary failed made the platform so heavy that it was impossible for the pilot to control the craft kinesthetically (by leaning), defeating the purpose of the design.
Fan Diameter (x2):2.13 m (7 ft) each
Platform Diameter:2.54 m (8 ft 4 in)
Height: 2.13 m (7 ft)
Weight:Empty, 168 kg (370 lb)
Gross, 252 kg (555 lb)
Engine:2 x Nelson H-59 two-cycle engines, 40 hp each
Top Speed:26 km/h (16 mph)
Manufacturer:Hiller Aircraft, Palo Alto, Ca.,1957
The Autosyn was a system developed by the Eclipse-Pioneer Division of the Bendix Aviation Corporation to eliminate the cumbersome plumbing required for instrumentation in increasingly large aircraft. Instead of having many feet of piping, vulnerable to blockage or leaks, the autosyn system used a transmitter located at the source of the input that converted the mechanical or electro-mechanical impulses from a sensor into electrical signals that were sent to a standardized indicator on the instrument panel. The indicator would have a simple easily mounted face that was appropriate to the input sensed by the transmitter.
This biocapsule carried Able, a female rhesus monkey, during the first flight to recover a primate from space. On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Able and Baker (a female squirrel monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The capsule was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960.
The Bücker Jungmeister dominated the aerobatic scene in Europe and the United States from the mid-1930s through the 1940s. Introduced in 1935 by Carl Bücker as a single-seat version of the Bü 131 A Jungmann, a two-place advanced aerobatic trainer, the Jungmeister became a favorite of European flying clubs.
Romanian pilot Alex Papana brought this Jungmeister to the United States crated in the airship Hindenburg and flew it at the 1937 Cleveland Air Races. Mike Murphy reregistered the airplane as his own and flew it to win the 1938 and '40 American Aerobatic Championships. Beverly "Bevo" Howard then bought it and won the '46 and '47 championships. Howard was killed in an accident in this airplane in 1971, but his estate restored the Jungmeister and donated it to the Smithsonian in 1973.
The Eagle was the first production Rolls-Royce aircraft engine to be used in service during World War I. Resulting from a 1914 British Admiralty requirement for an engine of about 186 kw (250 hp), development began in 1915. The first experimental engine was run in February 1915, developing 168 kw (225 hp). A total of 4,681 Eagles were manufactured at the Rolls-Royce Derby facility; 3,302 of the Eagle VIII models were built between 1917 and 1922.
The Eagle VIII powered a many British aircraft including: Airco D.H.4/4A and D.H.9A srs; ANEC III; B.A.T.F.K.26; Blackburn Blackbird; Curtiss H.12/H.16 Large America; de Havilland D.H.10C Amiens II/IIIC and D.H.16; Fairey F.17 Campania and IIIC/IIID; Felixstowe F.2A, F.3, and F.5; Handley Page H.P.12 O/400, H.P.15 V/1500, and H.P.18 W.8b; Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.2d; Short N.1B/N.2B Shirl; Sopwith Atlantic and Wallaby; Supermarine Commercial Amphibian and Sea Eagle; Vickers F.B.27 Vimy IV and 66 Vimy Commercial.
NASA used this Space Shuttle orbiter concept model in wind tunnel tests to learn about the flight characteristics of the vehicle's shape. Although the orbiter would spend most of its time in space, its aerodynamic shape would affect its passage through the atmosphere during launch and descent. Straight wing designs were considered and tested; however a delta wing design was finally chosen, in part to meet U.S. Air Force requirements for high cross-range maneuverability during final descent. Delta wings meant a heavier orbiter and more surface heating during reentry, but they also permitted the orbiter to glide farther without power to reach a runway. NASA transferred a variety of wind tunnel and concept models to the Museum after settling on the final Space Shuttle design.
During the 1920s William J. Powell led a small group of black air enthusiasts in Los Angeles. He established the Bessie Coleman Flying Club in 1929 and sponsored the first all-black air show on Labor Day 1931. As part of his effort to make aviation accessible to African American students, he taught classes on aeronautics at the Bessie Coleman Flying Club. This slide rule was among the equipment he used while teaching.
The speed and competition of air racing drew test pilot Darryl G. Greenamyer to the National Championship Air Races, held every September near Reno, Nevada, beginning in 1964. World War II fighters were some of the most powerful propeller-driven, piston-engine aircraft ever made, so they were ideal for the Unlimited Class, which dictated no restrictions to limit performance. Greenamyer and a team of fellow Lockheed Skunk Works employees used their engineering creativity to modify a Grumman F8F-2 Bearcat into a purpose-built air racer. Grumman designed the Bearcat late in World War II as a replacement for the F6F Hellcat Navy fighter. It was noted for its exceptional climbing ability and maneuverability. Conquest 1 featured a shorter wingspan than the production Bearcat, a special small bubble canopy, a larger propeller taken from a Douglas A-1 Skyraider, and a propeller spinner from a North American P-51H Mustang. Special high-octane gasoline, fuel additives, and putty-sealed gaps to reduce drag greatly increased its speed.
With registration number N1111L and assigned race number 1, the racer was known first as the “Greenamyer Bearcat” between 1964-1965 and 1968, and then Smirnoff after the team’s main sponsor for 1966 and 1967 before being christened Conquest I in 1969. Greenamyer and his team won the Unlimited championship six times between 1965-1969 and 1971 with the Bearcat.
Greenamyer also pursued records with Conquest I. On August 16, 1969, they broke the 30-year-old speed record for piston-engine aircraft held by German pilot Fritz Wendel in the Messerschmitt Me 209. The 1970 documentary Man for the Record captured for posterity their achievement of reaching 777 kilometers (483 miles) per hour over the California desert. Moving on to other racing and record-setting aircraft, Greenamyer donated Conquest I to the Smithsonian in 1977.
The Apollo Lunar Sample Return Container (ALSRC) was an aluminum box with a triple seal. It was used on Apollo lunar landing missions to preserve a lunar-like vacuum around the samples and protect them from the shock environment of the earth return flight. An aluminum mesh liner helped absorb the shock impacts. Prior to flight, each box was loaded with sample container bags and other sample containment devices. The "rock box" was then closed under vacuum so that it would not contain pressure greater than the lunar ambient pressure. On the moon, while samples were being loaded, the seals were protected by a Teflon film and a cloth cover which were removed just prior to closing the box. Two ALSRC's were used on each mission.
This particular ALSRC was used on Apollo 12. It contained two Teflon bags with the planned "selected sample" of 20 rocks and fine grained material. It was retained in "As Returned" condition by the Lunar Receiving Laboratory until 1977 and then transferred to the Smithsonian.
Lunar Orbiter was the project that mapped the Moon in preparation for the Apollo landings. A total of five Lunar Orbiters were flown to the Moon. They were built for NASA's Langley Research Center by Boeing and launched to the Moon on Atlas-Agena rockets. The first three orbited around the Moon's equator and provided detailed photographic coverage of the primary Apollo landing sites, including stereo images. Because of the success of these earlier missions, the final two Lunar Orbiters were placed into a polar orbit so that virtually the entire surface of the Moon was mapped. In addition to images of the Apollo landing sites, Lunar Orbiter provided many breathtaking photographs, including features on the farside.
In addition to the near global photographic coverage of the Moon, Lunar Orbiter provided additional information that aided Apollo. Sensors on board indicated that radiation levels near the Moon would pose no danger to the astronauts. Analysis of the spacecraft orbits found evidence of gravity perturbations, which suggested that the Moon was not gravatationally uniform. Instead it appeared as if buried concentrations of mass were under the mare deposits. By discovering and defining these "mascons," Lunar Orbiter made it possible for the Apollo missions to conduct highly accurate landings and precision rendezvous.
After depleting their film supplies, all five Lunar Orbiters were purposely crashed onto the Moon to prevent their radio transmitters from interfering with future spacecraft.
This French engine powered the Santos-Dumont Airship No. 9 in 1903. It performed two tasks: propulsion and the operation of a belt driven blower to pressurize the airship's envelope. Although designed for the Clement Autocyclette motorcycle, it was easily converted to aeronautical use because of its light weight and adequate power.
Alberto Santos-Dumont, a wealthy Brazilian based in Paris, first became famous by flying his dirigible No. 6 around the Eiffel Tower in 1901 and, in 1906, made the first airplane flight in Europe. This artifact was of special interest because it had "connected with it the smallest motor which has ever been successfully applied to a dirigible balloon." From the accession file, it appears that Airship No. 9 was to be flown at an exhibition in St. Louis in 1904, but was vandalized and not flown again.
Among the most successful early engines marketed in the United States were those designed and built by aviation pioneer and inventor Glenn Curtiss of Hammondsport, New York. Early Curtiss engines were designed to power motorcycles. In 1904 a two-cylinder, V-type motorcycle engine, believed to be the first Curtiss aircraft engine, was modified to power Capt. Thomas S. Baldwin's California Arrow, a small dirigible.
In 1926, Curtiss began the design of a 12-cylinder, two-row engine, the H-1640, that it hoped would surpass the performance of Pratt & Whitney's Wasp engine while having a considerably smaller frontal area. It had cylinders of the second row directly behind those of the first row, and the valves were operated by an overhead camshaft for each pair of cylinders. The H-1640 was certificated on September 13, 1928. The H-1640 powered the Curtiss P-11, Thomas-Morse XP-13, and Curtiss XP-14 aircraft. However, partly because of its extremely small diameter, this engine was not very successful.
The Supermarine Spitfire is a legend in British air history. With the Hawker Hurricane, it successfully defended England against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, and throughout the war it saw service on every major front. Performance and handling were superb. The Mk.VII, the second high-altitude version developed, was used in England and the Middle East. Several Mk 2EXVIs, the last production version to use the Merlin engine, remained in service through 1950. In all, 20,351 Spitfires were built.
The artifact in the collection is an engineering model, S-10, used for thermal control tests. It was reconfigured to represent a flight model of Surveyor 3 or later, since it was the first to have a scoop and claw surface sampler. After receipt in 1968 it was displayed in Smithsonian's Arts & Industries Building and then was moved to its present location in Gallery 112, Lunar Exploration Vehicles, in 1976.
The Surveyor series was designed to carry out soft landings on the Moon and provide data about its surface and possible atmosphere. These were the first U.S. probes to soft-land on the Moon. Once landed they provided detailed pictures of the surface by means of a TV camera carried on each of the spacecraft. Later Surveyors carried the instrumented soil mechanics surface scoop seen on the artifact. These were used to study the mechanical properties of lunar soil. Some of the spacecraft were also equipped to perform simple chemical analyses on lunar soil by means of alpha particle scattering. There were seven Surveyor launches starting in May, 1966, all launched by the Atlas-Centaur rocket. All but two successfully achieved program goals returning over 88,000 high resolution photographs and invaluable detailed data on the nature and strength of the lunar surface.
During the 1920s William J. Powell led a small group of black air enthusiasts in Los Angeles. He established the Bessie Coleman Flying Club in 1929 and sponsored the first all-black air show on Labor Day 1931. As part of his effort to make aviation accessible to African American students, he taught classes on aeronautics at the Bessie Coleman Flying Club. This drafting pen was among the equipment he used while teaching.
The Apollo Lunar Module (LM) was a two-stage vehicle designed by Grumman to ferry two astronauts from lunar orbit to the lunar surface and back. The upper ascent stage consisted of a pressurized crew compartment, equipment areas, and an ascent rocket engine. The lower descent stage had the landing gear and contained the descent rocket engine and lunar surface experiments.
LM 2 was built for a second unmanned Earth-orbit test flight. Because the test flight of LM 1, performed as part of the Apollo 5 mission, was so successful, a second unmanned LM test mission was deemed unnecessary. LM-2 was used for ground testing prior to the first successful Moon-landing mission. In 1970 the ascent stage of LM-2 spent several months on display at the "Expo '70" in Osaka, Japan. When it returned to the United States, it was reunited with its descent stage, modified to appear like the Apollo 11 Lunar Module "Eagle," and transferred to the Smithsonian for display.
This propeller is from Eugene Ely's Curtiss Model D pusher biplane that he flew as part of the U.S. Navy's early investigations into the military uses of aviation. On November 14, 1910, Ely made the first take-off from a ship, the cruiser USS Birmingham, in Hampton Roads, Virginia. Three months later, Ely made the first landing on a ship, the battleship USS Pennsylvania in San Francisco Bay, on January 18, 1911, while using the first ever tailhook system. Ely died later on October 19, 1911, after crashing during an exhibition flight in Macon, Georgia.
At the time of the propeller's donation in 1931, Ely's father, Col. Nathan Dana Ely, described it as being from the Hampton Roads take-off flight and in the condition as received from his son. Ely's Model D came so close to the water that the propeller tips hit the crest of a wave causing them to splinter, which can be seen today. Subsequent information from a family acquaintance interviewing Ely's wife in the late 1950s suggested that the Hampton Roads propeller was kept by a benefactor and that the propeller held by the Smithsonian was likely from the San Francisco landing flight.
The Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV) was a battery powered "dune buggy" taken to the moon on Apollo missions 15, 16, and 17. The LRV was stowed on the descent stage of the Lunar Module and deployed upon arrival at the lunar surface. The LRV was operated with a spacecraft "stick," rather than a steering wheel.
In addition to the flight vehicles, Boeing manufactured eight non-flight units for development and testing. One, the "Qualification Test Unit," was a very close replica of the units that flew. Using special test chambers, engineers purposely subjected the qualification unit to conditions many times as severe as those expected on an actual mission. When the tests were finished, given the stresses it had been subject to, the qualification unit could not safely be used in space. In 1975, NASA transferred it to the Museum.
The Model 4X engine was built by the Roberts Motor Company of Sandusky, Ohio. An important design objective was light weight, which was achieved through the extensive use of aluminum and magnesium alloys in the cylinders and crankcase, and a hollow crankshaft. Also like all Roberts engines it operated on a two-stroke cycle operation to reduce parts count. Between 1911 and 1912, Roberts engines were used by many noted exhibition pilots, and more Roberts engines were said to be built than by Hall-Scott and Curtiss combined during this period.
This engine artifact was manufactured about 1911 and powered a Curtiss-type, float-equipped aircraft (hydroplane) built by Harry H. Ford. Mr. Ford was a self-taught pilot and did most of his flying between 1912 and 1913 in the area of the Bridgeport, Connecticut harbor.
Appearing in mid 1917, the Nieuport 28C.1 was rejected by the French in favor of the sturdier, more advanced Spad XIII. Having no suitable fighter design of its own, the United States adopted the Nieuport 28 as a stop-gap measure before the much-in-demand Spad XIIIs could be made available from the French. It was the first fighter aircraft to serve with an American fighter unit under American command and in support of U.S. troops. It was also first type to score an aerial victory with an American unit.
The Nieuport 28 also made its mark in U.S. aviation history after the war. Twelve were employed by the U.S. Navy for shipboard launching trials from 1919 to 1921. Others were operated by the U.S. Army in the 1920s. In private hands, several were modified for air racing, and a number found their way into Hollywood movies. Still others became privately-owned airplanes flying in various sporting and commercial capacities.
Begun in 1925 by former Wright Aeronautical employees as a spinoff from a machine tool company, Pratt & Whitney became one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aircraft engines, and the Wasp Jr. is one of the most successful reciprocating engines ever built. Pratt & Whitney introduced it as a complement to the highly successful Wasp and Hornet families of engines in 1930. The Wasp Jr. was essentially a Wasp of reduced dimensions. Pratt & Whitney and its licensees manufactured over 39,000 versions of the R-985 until 1953 for a wide variety of military and commercial aircraft, including light transports, trainers, sport aircraft, and helicopters.
The R-985-AN-14B powered the McDonnell XHJH-1 and XHJD-1 Whirlaway helicopters and the Avro Anson V trainer. This Wasp Jr.-aptly nicknamed "The Dancing Engine"- has been sectionalized and motorized to demonstrate the movements of its internal components.
On their path to the first successful powered airplane, the 1903 Wright Flyer, the Wright brothers built three full-size gliders to test their design ideas regarding control, aerodynamics, and structures. The first one in 1900 produced less lift than the brothers' calculations predicted, but its wing-warping system for lateral control and forward elevator for pitch control worked beautifully. The Wrights primarily flew the 1900 glider as a kite, with no pilot aboard, to test its performance, but they did make a few free glides with Wilbur Wright as pilot, totaling two minutes in the air.
None of the three experimental Wright gliders exist. The Wrights did not preserve them because they saw them merely as research tools, and they were rather beat up from testing. This reproduction was built during the 2003 Wright centennial year. Numerous groups and individuals built reproduction Wright aircraft to celebrate the first century of powered flight and to learn more about the Wright brothers' inventive process.
The Fleet Model 2 was a primary flight trainer at the Roosevelt Aviation School, Long Island, New York, one of the leading civilian aviation schools in the U.S. in the 1930s. It was one of ten Fleet aircraft owned by Roosevelt Field, out of about 350 Fleet aircraft built between 1929 and 1942. Hundreds of student pilots received instruction in this Fleet at Roosevelt Field or later in Pennsylvania in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, which provided pilots for military service during World War II.
Designed by Major Reuben Fleet as a smaller version of the military PT-3 trainer, the compact and relatively inexpensive Fleet was the first aircraft specifically designed for the civilian flight training market. In September 1979, Eugene Breiner, an FAA Principal Airworthiness Inspector, purchased NC8689 and restored it to its 1939 Roosevelt Field trainer configuration. In 1985, Breiner’s Plane Jane, so named because it was a just a plain simple airplane, returned to flying status.
This engine powered the last generation of piston engine transports, including the Douglas DC-7 and Lockheed Super Constellation. It represents the end of engine-development that began with the famous Wright Whirlwind, and included an entire family of military and commercial piston power plants. The somewhat unique feature of this engine was a turbo compound device, consisting of an exhaust-driven turbine geared to the crankshaft, generating 20 percent additional take-off power without increasing fuel consumption.
The Wright R-3350 Turbo-Cyclone 18 also powered the following aircraft types: Lockheed P2V-7 Neptune patrol bomber, Martin P5M-1 and -2 Marlin patrol flying boat, Fairchild C-119F and G Packet troop and cargo transport, Lockheed C-121 transport, and Canadair CL-28 maritime reconnaissance.
This artifact powered the American Airlines Douglas DC-7C "Flagship Vermont." A total of 374 engines of this model were built between August 1952 and December 1954. A total of 5,656 commercial C18 and 44,536 military R-3350 engines were manufactured.
The V-1 (Vergeltungswaffe Eins, or Vengeance Weapon One), was the world's first operational cruise missile. This name was given to it by the Nazi Propaganda Ministry, but the original Air Ministry designation was Fi 103, after its airframe designer, the Fieseler company. Powered by a simple but noisy pulsejet that earned it the Allied nicknames of "buzz bomb" and "doodle bug," more than 20,000 were launched at British and continental targets, mostly London and Antwerp, from June 1944 to March 1945. It carried a one-ton, high-explosive warhead and had a range of about 240 km (150 miles) but was very inaccurate.
The Smithsonian acquired this V-1 on 1 May 1949 from the U.S. Air Force. It was moved to the National Air Museum's storage facility in Suitland, Maryland in January 1955 and was restored in 1975-76 for exhibition in the new National Air and Space Museum building.
Prior to undertaking construction of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) the Lockheed Missile and Space Company built a full-scale mockup in 1975 for conducting various feasibility studies. Initially a low-fidelity metal cylinder for testing handling procedures for the proposed spacecraft, the test vehicle evolved continuously as Lockheed proceeded through its feasibility studies and was awarded the contract to build the actual spacecraft. The test vehicle eventually served as a frame on which the cables and wiring harnesses for the actual spacecraft were fabricated. It was also used for simulations in developing maintenance and repair activities in orbit. Dynamic studies on the test vehicle including vibration studies and thermal studies led to its being designated the Hubble Space Telescope Structural Dynamic Test Vehicle (SDTV).
The artifact was stored outdoors at Lockheed in Sunnyvale Ca., until it was donated to NASM in June 1987 and shipped to the Garber facility. There it was refurbished and restored to its 1976 configuration. In 1996 the SDTV was removed from exhibit in order to upgrade the object to simulate the actual HST as it was being deployed from the Shuttle. This major upgrade, generously supported and executed by Lockheed, HST subcontractors, the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, and NASM staff and volunteers, involved fabricating the equipment section for the Optical Telescope Assembly, the aperture door, high gain antennae, solar arrays, aft shroud handrails, and numerous other details. A major addition was realistic multi-layer (non-flight) thermal blanketing and taping, interface hardware, wave guides, and the umbilical. NASA also provided a large equipment cradle to allow the upgraded object to be displayed from the floor at a dramatic angle.
On July 12, 1957, Dwight D. Eisenhower became the first President of the United States to fly in this helicopter. The occasion was a simulated nuclear alert staged to test how quickly the Chief Executive and other government officials could depart Washington, D. C. and reach a safe haven outside the city. During 1957, the Bell Helicopter Corporation modified a stock Bell H-13J helicopter to meet the President's special needs. Technicians added all-metal rotor blades, special arm and foot rests to the right seat, and a frame-less, Plexiglas nose bubble heavily tinted to reduce glare and heat. Eisenhower's personal helicopter pilot, United States Air Force Major Joseph E. Barrett, flew the rotorcraft from the center seat and a Secret Service agent occupied the left seat.
An identical Bell H-13J, assigned the Air Force serial number 57-2728, usually accompanied the President's helicopter. This aircraft carried his physician and another Secret Service agent.
The Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan produced the world’s first quantity-production 12-cylinder automobile in in 1916, and belief in that engine carried over to aviation in the following year. Particularly beginning with lessons learned with the World War I era Liberty engines, Packard began development of 12-cylinder aircraft engines in 1923 that would better fully meet requirements of the Army and Navy, with a resulting great step forward made in decreasing the weight per horsepower.
The engines in the Packard 2500 series were built in direct drive and geared types. The development of the 3A-2500, like its predecessors the 1A-2500 and 2A-2500, was sponsored by both the Army and the Navy. By 1927, the Model 2500 was the most powerful standard aircraft engine in existence. It powered the Huff-Daland XHB-1 Cyclops, the Martin 3-Purpose Aircraft, Dornier Superwal, and Boeing PB-1. The Packard 3A-2500 was type certificated for commercial use in January 1929.
Designed by Robert Fulton Jr., the Airphibian in 1950 became the first roadable aircraft approved by the Civil Aviation Administration. It could fly to an airport and then, after disengaging wings, tail, and propeller, become a car. Other roadable aircraft, such as Waldo Waterman's Arrow/Aerobile and William Stout's Skycar (both in the Museum's collection), had been built but none earned certification.
While a technical success as a flying car, the Airphibian did not become a marketable design due to the inherent compromises of air and car technologies and financial difficulties. A former company officer donated the Airphibian in 1960 and Robert Fulton III restored it in 1998.
First built in 1937, the Piper J-3 earned fame as a trainer and sport plane. Its success made the name "Cub" a generic term for light airplanes. The little yellow tail dragger remains one of the most recognized designs in aviation. J-3 Cubs and subsequent models are still found at fields around the world. Thousands of pilots, including three-fourths of those in the Civilian Pilot Training Program, trained in Cubs.
William T. Piper and Piper Aircraft are one of general aviation's greatest success stories. Piper took Gilbert Taylor's Tiger Kitten and E-2 designs and, with Walter Jamoneau, built the Taylor and Piper J-2, then the legendary Piper J-3. When production ended in 1947, 19,888 Piper Cubs had been built. This Cub was built in 1941 and accumulated more than 6,000 hours of flying time before being restored in 1975.
The Wright brothers designed and constructed the world's first practical fixed-pitch propeller and developed the aerodynamic theory to calculate its performance during the process of creating their historic 1903 Flyer. Conceptualizing the propeller as a rotating, twisted wing moving in a helical path, the brothers used airfoil data obtained from their wind tunnel to design blades able to convert power from their small engine into thrust.
Believing that "the propeller should in every case be designed to meet the particular conditions of the machine to which it is applied," the Wrights designed their propellers (they used two on the airplane) for one specific performance regime. Using a drawknife and hatchets, they shaped the propellers from two laminated pieces of spruce, covered the tips with linen, and sealed them with aluminum powder suspended in varnish. Overall, these two propellers produced 66 percent efficiency, enough to get off the ground at Kitty Hawk.
This original propeller was used on the 1903 Wright Flyer on December 17, 1903, during its first flight.
Larry Bell gambled that a thriving market for personal helicopters would develop after World War II. If he could position the Bell Aircraft Corporation to feed this market, the firm might survive the transition from war to peace. Once hostilities ceased, the government would immediately cancel contracts for the firm's military aircraft. The Bell Model 30 Ship 1A proved that a practical personal helicopter was feasible and it led directly to the Bell Model 47. This rotorcraft has remained in worldwide service longer than any other helicopter and many operators around the world continued to fly the Bell 47 in 2001.
Astronaut John Glenn Jr. carried these binoculars, manufactured by Hensoldt-Wetzlar, into space during the during the flight of Friendship 7, the first U.S. orbital flight carrying a human on February 20, 1962.
Test pilot Mike Melvill wore this suit on June 21, 2004, during the first privately funded spaceflight of SpaceShipOne. After its launch from a carrier aircraft called White Knight, Melvill piloted SpaceShipOne to an altitude of 100 km (62 miles) before returning to land in Mojave, California. This test flight paved the way for two subsequent flights that earned the SpaceShipOne team the $10 million Ansari X Prize for the first privately funded spaceflights. Melvill also wore this suit on September 29, 2004, during one of those award-winning flights. Melvill partnered with Burt Rutan in a long career of designing and flight testing experimental aircraft. He gave his flight suit and accessories to the Museum in 2005 when SpaceShipOne entered the national collection of historic aircraft and spacecraft.
Known to all as the "T-Bird," the T-33 was the only jet trainer in the U.S. Air Force inventory from 1948 until 1957 when the Cessna T-37 "Tweet" took to the skies. The T-Bird served as an instrument trainer, utility aircraft, and test platform. The prototype first flew on March 22, 1948, piloted by acclaimed test pilot Tony LeVier. It handled much like the P-80C. It was officially designated T-33A on May 5, 1949.
The Museum's T-33A-5-LO, serial no. 53-5226N, was accepted by the USAF on September 16, 1954, and delivered to the DC Air National Guard at Andrews Air Force Base where it served until its transfer to the museum on October 30, 1987. The Museum's aircraft has never been painted and has a highly polished natural metal finish. Used primarily as a training aircraft, all guns have been removed.
In mid-1911, Harry Atwood and Charles Hamilton flew a Burgess Model F Moth aircraft from Boston to Washington, setting a 737.9 km (461.2 miles) flight distance record. Stops included New London, New York, Asbury Park, and Atlantic City. Disparity between the 14 hour flight time and 12 day trip is probably not surprising considering contemporary aircraft development and operational and logistical support. Subsequently, Atwood landed on the White House lawn and was decorated by President Taft with the Aero Club of America's gold medal.
The Model F Moth, a copy of the Wright Model B, is a pusher airplane powered by a Wright Vertical 4 engine driving two propellers. This is believed to be an original left hand propeller, damaged landing near Baltimore and replaced by propellers made by the American Propeller and Manufacturing Company. It is one of a 21 propeller collection donated to the museum in 1930 by the American Propeller and Manufacturing Co, Baltimore.
Charles Lawrance, originally a race car engine designer, built his first air-cooled aircraft engine in 1921 for a Navy contract. The J-1 was the first practical American radial and satisfied a Navy need for a compact lightweight engine for use on aircraft carriers, not plagued with water leakage problems.
Used in aircraft such as the Curtiss TS-1, the engine had superior performance, weighed less, and was easier to maintain than liquid-cooled engines in comparable aircraft. With encouragement from the Navy, Lawrance merged with Wright, and the J-1 developed into the famous Whirlwind series. Despite its higher initial cost relative to other engines available at the time, the Whirlwind’s reliability and lower operating cost resulted in widespread use.
The most famous Wright Whirlwind application was the 1927 New York-to-Paris flight of Charles Lindbergh. In 1928, Charles Lawrance was awarded the Collier Trophy for the outstanding performance of his engines based on records set in 1927.
By the end of Project Mercury, Hasselblad cameras such as this one, used in the Apollo 11 command module, became the standard for still photography on American space missions. Known for their high quality construction and ease of use, the electric Swedish-made cameras featured a motor-driven mechanism that prepared the film and shutter when the camera was activated. Hasselblad cameras could be modified for use inside the spacecraft or on the lunar surface, with easily detachable black and white or color film magazines.
NASA transferred this camera to the Museum in 1970.
This Mercury capsule, number 15B, is one of two left showing the complete one-man spacecraft in its orbital configuration. It includes the silver and black retrorocket package used to slow the capsule for return to Earth and the nose section containing the parachutes. The first American in space, Alan B. Shepard, Jr., hoped to fly this Mercury capsule on a long-duration orbital mission in late 1963 called Mercury-Atlas 10 (MA-10). After the success of MA-9, flown by astronaut Gordon Cooper in May 1963, NASA decided to cancel MA-10 to concentrate on its next human spaceflight project, Gemini. Reflecting Shepard's hope of flying in space again, he had the name Freedom 7 II, in tribute to his historic 1961 capsule, Freedom 7, painted on the spacecraft.
In September 1967 NASA transferred the capsule to the Smithsonian Institution.
America's first swept-wing jet fighter, the F-86 Sabre joined the ranks of great fighter aircraft during combat operations high above the Yalu River in Korea. Even though they could not pursue the enemy across the Chinese border, Sabre pilots established an impressive shoot-down advantage against enemy MiGs. Sabre designers capitalized on captured German aerodynamic data, which showed that swept wings delayed air compressibility effects encountered at high subsonic airspeeds. Swept-wing aircraft could therefore be controlled at much higher speeds than similar straight-wing aircraft.
This F-86A saw combat against MiG-15s during the Korean War. It flew most of its missions from Kimpo Air Base near Seoul and bears the markings of the 4th Fighter Wing, the first F-86 unit in Korea.
All aircraft designers attempt to maximize lifting power and reduce airframe weight. During the late 1940s, helicopter pioneers began to experiment with alternative propulsion methods that did not require heavy components such as tail rotor assemblies, drive shafts, main rotor clutches, transmissions, and engine cooling blowers. Without these items, a helicopter's useful load increases by a significant margin. These components are also potential failure points, making helicopters more fragile and more difficult to maintain. Yet another advantage is the substantial reduction in the cost to produce helicopters without this equipment. In 1948, Stanley Hiller began to experiment with ramjets mounted on the tips of the main rotor blade. He hoped to make small, ramjet-powered helicopters practical and affordable, and to eventually design and sell giant aerial cranes propelled by ramjets or jet turbine engines. The Hiller HOE-1 became the first production ramjet helicopter, and the Army and Navy flew a small number of these aircraft for a short time to test and evaluate the technology.
Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron Nine, "Sea Griffins."
The Self-Recording Penetrometer was a device used on Apollo 15 and 16 to measure some mechanical properties of the lunar soil. When an astronaut pushed on the upper end, the bearing plate or lower cone and shaft would penetrate into the lunar soil while the reference pad stayed on the surface. A retractor cable mechanism running from the reference pad to the upper housing actuated a stylus which would move axially along the recording drum to measure the depth of penetration. The force applied through the extension handle by the astronaut was measured by a coil spring which caused the recording drum to rotate under the stylus by an amount proportional to the force. The LSRP had a maximum penetration depth of 76 cm and the ability to measure penetration force to a maximum of 111 Newtons. Upon return to Earth, the results from these tests were analyzed.
This item was used for training and was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1974.
Amelia Earhart set two of her many aviation records in this bright red Lockheed 5B Vega. In 1932 she flew it alone across the Atlantic Ocean, then flew it nonstop across the United States-both firsts for a woman.
Introduced in 1927, the Vega was the first product of designer Jack Northrop and Allan Loughead's Lockheed Aircraft Company. Sturdy, roomy, streamlined and fast, the innovative Vega became favored by pilots seeking to set speed and distance records. It sported a cantilever (internally braced) one-piece spruce wing and a spruce veneer monocoque fuselage (a molded shell without internal bracing), which increased overall strength and reduced weight. A NACA engine cowling and wheel pants reduced drag and provided streamline style.
Amelia Earhart bought this 5B Vega in 1930 and called it her "Little Red Bus." After a nose-over accident later that year, the fuselage was replaced and strengthened to carry extra fuel tanks. Three types of compasses, a drift indicator, and a more powerful engine were also installed.
On May 20-21, 1932, flying in this airplane, Earhart became the first woman (and the only person since Charles Lindbergh) to fly nonstop and alone across the Atlantic Ocean. She took off from Harbor Grace, Newfoundland, Canada and landed 15 hours and 2,026 miles later in a field near Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The feat made Earhart an instant worldwide sensation and proved she was a courageous and able pilot.
Later that year, Earhart flew the Vega to another record. On August 24-25, she made the first solo, nonstop flight by a woman across the United States, from Los Angeles to Newark, New Jersey. The flight covered a distance of 2,447 miles and lasted about 19 hours.
Earhart sold her 5B Vega to Philadelphia's Franklin Institute in 1933 after purchasing a new Lockheed 5C Vega. The Smithsonian acquired it in 1966.
Immediately after World War II ended, Earnest Schweizer designed the SGU 2-22EK. Earnest and his brothers, Paul and William, hoped to produce and sell an inexpensive, easy-to-fly, two-seat training glider built from aluminum that could operate from small airfields. The Schweizer Aircraft Corporation built 257 examples of the 2-22 from 1946 to 1967. Thousands of people acquired the skill to fly motorless aircraft at the controls of the 2-22 and many of these airplanes remain active in 2003.
Byron G. "Scotty" McCray flew this Schweizer 2-22EK from 1966 to 1973 at airshows in the United States, Canada, and the Bahamas. His routine began at about 760-912 m (2,500-3,000 ft). After releasing from the tow airplane, McCray looped, rolled, and spun the 2-22 down to a silent landing. He synchronized his maneuvers to the theme music from the Hollywood film Born Free while audiences heard the melody booming through the airshow public address system.
Discovery was the third Space Shuttle orbiter vehicle to fly in space. It entered service in 1984 and retired from spaceflight as the oldest and most accomplished orbiter, the champion of the shuttle fleet. Discovery flew on 39 Earth-orbital missions, spent a total of 365 days in space, and traveled almost 240 million kilometers (150 million miles)--more than the other orbiters. It shuttled 184 men and women into space and back, many of whom flew more than once, for a record-setting total crew count of 251.
Because Discovery flew every kind of mission the Space Shuttle was meant to fly, it embodies well the 30-year history of U.S. human spaceflight from 1981 to 2011. Named for renowned sailing ships of exploration, Discovery is preserved as intact as possible as it last flew in 2011 on the 133rd Space Shuttle mission.
NASA transferred Discovery to the Smithsonian in April 2012 after a delivery flight over the nation's capital.
In 1973 and 1974, Bill Bennett and his hang glider designers experimented with several variations of the standard Rogallo wing. He then incorporated the results into a new line of hang gliders called the Phoenix series. On these gliders, Bennett increased the leading-edge convergence angle from 80 to more than 95 degrees. Total wing surface area was slightly less than standard Rogallo models, but the aspect ratio (wingspan to wing chord ratio) increased substantially. The first Phoenix hang gliders flew with a long fantail, a device thought to improve stability. As Bennett continued to develop the Phoenix series, he increased the leading-edge convergence angle even further, and removed the fantail after flight experience showed that it did not increase stability. The docile handling characteristics and good stability of the Phoenix VI made it a popular trainer at hang glider flying schools. More experienced pilots also favored this model type because it flew relatively fast, had good rough air penetration and handling characteristics, and the glider could soar on updrafts far better than earlier standard Rogallo designs. This success encouraged Bennett to develop the Phoenix series further, and variations continued to appear well into the 1980s.
In the next variant, the Phoenix VI.B, Bennett and Boone made 'deflexor' cables mounted on the wing leading edges a standard feature. Pilots could tighten or loosen these wires to change the wing’s shape for better flying performance and increased stability. During assembly at the factory, technicians rigged and tuned the glider to fly with a tendency to pitch up in high-speed flight. This built-in auto-recovery mode helped pilots recover safely from high-speed dives. The VI.B also used wing tip battens arranged in a radial pattern. This technique made the tips stiffer, reducing drag and improving roll response. The keel of the 'VI.B was shortened and Bennett added additional battens that extended all the way from the wing leading edge to the trailing edge. With these modifications, performance improved at low and high speeds.
The Liberty engine was America's most important contribution to aeronautical technology during World War I. Jesse G. Vincent of Packard and Elbert J. Hall of Hall-Scott co-designed it in mid-1917 for the U.S. government, which wanted a standard design in 4-, 6-, 8-, and 12-cylinder versions that could be quickly mass-produced to equip U.S. combat aircraft. Automakers Ford, Lincoln, Packard, Marmon, and Buick produced 20,748 Liberty 12s before the Armistice, which insured their widespread use into the 1920s and '30s.
Details of the turbo-supercharger design were based on experience of the turbine and centrifugal compressor departments of the General Electric Company, where the first one was built at its facility in Lynn, Massachusetts, led by Dr. Sanford Moss.
The Packard Motor Car Company built the engine, and GE built the turbo-supercharger assembly. Turbo-supercharged Liberty engines powered aircraft such as the: LePere LUSAC-11, Martin MB-2 (NBS-1), de Havilland XDH-4BS and DH-4M-2S.
The Mercury space capsule carried this device, designed by the Honeywell Corporation, which allowed the astronaut to see his orbital track and heading. For example, it indicated when the spacecraft was passing over a ground station or a landing site. The device was a simple globe, driven by a clockwork mechanism. Once in a stable orbit, the astronaut would wind up the clockwork, and set the position of a tiny scale model of the Mercury capsule, under which the globe would rotate.
This specimen was flown aboard MA-4, an unmanned Mercury flight that preceeded the manned flights.
Transferred from NASA to the Museum in 1972.
Famed designer Mark Birkigt was from Switzerland, but his aircraft engines were built elsewhere. Hispano-Suiza engines were built in company factories in France and Spain, but also under license in England and the United States. In 1916, the Wright-Martin Corporation was formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey in order to begin quantity production of the 112 kW (150 shp) Hispano-Suiza Model A engine ordered by the French government. Over time, among the additional Hispano-Suiza engine models developed were the 134 kW (180 shp) Model E and the 224 kW (300 hp) Model H.
In 1919, Wright-Martin became Wright Aeronautical Corporation and made improvements in the Model H by raising its output to 280 (375 shp). The engine was then designated H-3. In 1922, the H-3 was considered the lightest and most efficient pursuit engine in the world.
Fred Wiseman, a successful automobile racing driver from Santa Rosa, California, began construction of an airplane in October 1909 in San Francisco. It was based on elements of Wright, Curtiss, and Farman designs, three of the most successful manufacturers of the day. Successful test flights were made in the spring of 1910, making it the first airplane built in California to fly.
In May 1910, as the first Wiseman airplane was being tested, construction started on a second aircraft. Wiseman made all his significant exhibition flights using this airplane, including the first air mail flight officially sanctioned by a U.S. post office, from Petaluma to Santa Rosa, California, in February 1911.
In early 1912, the second Wiseman airplane was acquired by Weldon B. Cooke, a pilot who had been making a name for himself in recent months flying another airplane in the NASM collection, the Maupin-Lanteri Black Diamond. The second Wiseman airplane is now designated by NASM as the "Wiseman-Cooke aircraft" because both individuals were intimately associated with its history.
In this historic capsule, John H. Glenn Jr. became the first American to orbit the Earth. Glenn's flight was the third manned mission of Project Mercury, following two suborbital flights by astronauts in 1961. Glenn's three-orbit mission on February 20, 1962, was a sterling success, as he overcame problems with the automatic control system that would have ended an unmanned flight. But reentry was tense, as a faulty telemetry signal from the spacecraft indicated that the heat shield might be loose. Mission Control instructed Glenn not to jettison the retrorocket package after firing in order to better hold the heat shield in place. Glenn reentered successfully and splashed down in the Atlantic 4 hours, 55 minutes and 23 seconds after launch.
NASA transferred Friendship 7 to the Smithsonian Institution in 1963, which has exhibited it in buildings on the National Mall ever since.
On May 20-21, 1927, Charles Lindbergh literally flew into history when he crossed the Atlantic Ocean in his Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis, thus becoming the first pilot to fly solo and nonstop from New York to Paris. This flight made Lindbergh a household name and catapulted him into fame and celebrity. The objects of popular culture in the National Collection display everything from ashtrays to wristwatches reflect the public adulation for Lindbergh and the powerful commercial response to his celebrity. More than 75 years after the Spirit's historic flight, Lindbergh's name still has the power help sell manufactured goods.
Operating from U.S. Navy airships during the early 1930s, diminutive Curtiss F9C-2 Sparrowhawks tested one of the more imaginative ideas in aviation history. Deployed with the USS Akron and Macon, they turned these airships into flying aircraft carriers. The airplanes, which could be released and recovered in flight, were to be used for attack, for defense of the airships, and to greatly increase search range for the Navy's giant, helium-filled dirigibles.
Eight Sparrowhawks were produced for this purpose. The first arrived at Lakehurst Naval Air Station, New Jersey, in June 1932, and experimental trials with airship-based fighter support were brief. The Akron was lost in a storm on April 4, 1933; the Macon crashed off the California coast on February 12, 1935. Before these accidents, not a single Sparrowhawk was lost. However, with only three remaining, and no dirigible from which to operate, the aircraft were relegated to utility flying.
The first crossing of the United States by airplane was achieved by Calbraith Perry Rodgers in 1911. In 1910, famed publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst announced his offer of a $50,000-prize for a U.S. transcontinental flight in thirty days or less. Rodgers' Wright EX biplane was named the Vin Fiz after his sponsor's grape soda product. He left Sheepshead Bay, New York, on September 17, 1911. A "hangar" car, a rolling workshop filled with spare parts to repair and maintain the airplane, followed along. The flight was punctuated by numerous stops, delays, and accidents. When Hearst's 30-day time limit expired, Rodgers had only reached Kansas City, Missouri. Undaunted, he continued on, determined to make the first transcontinental airplane flight whether he received the money or not. He arrived in Pasadena, California, to a hero's welcome, 49 days after setting out. Although Pasadena was the official end of the coast-to-coast journey, Rodgers flew on to Long Beach to complete the flight at the shore of the Pacific Ocean. The total distance covered was 6,914 km (4,321 mi) in 82 hours, 4 minutes, total flying time at an average speed of 82.4 kph (51.5 mph).
Leonard Niemi's Sisu is one of the most successful American competition sailplane ever flown. John Ryan in 1962, Dean Svec in 1965, and A. J. Smith in 1967, all won the United States National Soaring Championships flying a Sisu ('see-soo'). In 1967, Bill Ivans (his Schempp-Hirth Nimbus II in NASM collection) set a national speed record flying a Sisu 1A at El Mirage, California, by skimming across the desert at 135 kph (84 mph) over a 100-kilometer (62-mile) triangular course.
Alvin H. Parker took off from his hometown, Odessa, Texas, at the controls of the National Air and Space Museum's Sisu 1A and flew 1,042 km (647 miles) on July 31, 1964. This flight also shattered a symbolic and psychological barrier that had defeated sailplane pilots around the world for years. Joseph Lincoln called the 1,000-km milestone "for a good many years …the soaring pilot's four-minute mile on both sides of the Atlantic" in his soaring anthology, "On Quiet Wings," published in 1972.
Mars Pathfinder was the first spacecraft to land on the surface of the red planet since the Viking mission in 1976. It was launched on December 4, 1996. On reaching Mars on July 4, 1997, the spacecraft entered the planet's thin atmosphere, was slowed by a parachute and then rockets, and then landed by bouncing on inflated airbags. Once on the surface, the protective aeroshell unfolded to provide three flat platforms and ramps, one of which held a rover (Sojourner). The Sojourner rover traveled down one of the ramps and proceeded to take close up images of the surface using two black and white cameras on the front and a color camera on the rear. The rover also featured a rear-mounted Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer that provided bulk elemental composition data on surface soils and rocks.
The Marie Curie rover was the flight spare for the Sojouner rover. During Sojourner's activites on Mars, engineers operated Marie Curie in the same movements in a Mars-like test area at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. For a time, NASA planned to send Marie Curie on a 2001 Mars mission, but this did not occur. Today, these two rovers--one still on Mars and its twin here--represent the first successful exploration of the Martian surface with a moving vehicle.
JPL transferred the Marie Curie rover to the Museum in 2015.
The first successful rotary engine is generally attributed to F.O. Farwell in 1896, and was built by the Adams Company of Dubuque, Iowa. A three cylinder version likely powered the first rubber-tired automobile in 1899.
Because of its light weight, this five cylinder engine was selected by Emile Berliner, an inventor possibly better known in the acoustics field, to drive a helicopter's vertical shaft in a 1908 "test rig." It was reported by the New York Times on July 1, 1909 that a helicopter jointly designed by Berliner and J. Newton Williams, using two of these engines, successfully lifted a few feet off the ground in the last week of June 1909 with Williams aboard.
During this same period, Berliner formed the Gyro Motor Company to pursue development of the rotary engine in aviation, but the French Gnome engine was much more successful in bringing the rotary to a broad aviation market.
The RQ-2A provides field commanders with real-time reconnaissance, surveillance, target acquisition, and battle damage information. Ground controllers pilot the aircraft over its 185-kilometer (115-mile) range. The RQ-2A can be recovered by flying into a large net aboard a ship or by using a tail hook and arresting wire on land. Its small size and composite materials make the RQ-2A difficult to detect visually and on radar.
U.S. Army, Navy, and Marine units began using RQ-2As in the late 1980s. This one operated from the battleship Wisconsin during the 1991 Gulf War. While it was assessing damage from naval gunfire to targets on Faylaka Island near Kuwait City, several Iraqi soldiers signaled their intention to surrender to the aircraft during a low pass-the first time enemy soldiers had ever surrendered to an unmanned aerial vehicle. They were later captured by U.S. ground troops.
Among the most successful early engines marketed in the United States were those designed and built by aviation pioneer and inventor Glenn Curtiss in his factory in Hammondsport, New York. Early Curtiss engines were designed to power motorcycles. The Curtiss V-X was manufactured in Hammondsport and Buffalo beginning in 1915 to power the R series of Curtiss biplanes, especially the R-6 and R-9 training seaplanes and R-4 training landplane. Modified examples of the latter type were used by the Army in its 1916 operations on the Mexican border and for carrying U.S. mail.
With the advent of World War I, Curtiss concentrated its production on the 67 kW (90 hp) OX-5 engine which powered the JN-4D “Jenny” trainer aircraft. The U.S. Government's Liberty engine fulfilled the need for a higher power engine; therefore, the V-X engines were phased out before reaching large-scale production.
Hispano-Suiza engines were developed by Marc Birkigt, of Swiss origin, and first manufactured in Barcelona for use in automobiles. Hisso engines were very successful and featured innovative cast-aluminum cylinder construction with internal water passages. World War I, in particular, required licensing of Hisso aircraft engine manufacturing in France, England and the U.S. to meet increased aviation demand. They were all licensed under Birkigt patents which covered the number of features vital to the engine concept.
In 1916, the Wright-Martin Corporation (later Wright Aeronautical) was formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey to begin quantity production of the first Hispano-Suiza aircraft engine, the Model A, ordered by the Societe d'Exploitation des Materiels Hispano-Suiza for the Spad fighter. In the U.S., it was principally used during World War I on U.S. military training aircraft such as the Curtiss JN-4H. After the war, surplus Jennys were widely used for "barnstorming" traveling air shows-and opened the first scheduled air mail service.
This is the flight backup for the mapping cameras used on the last three Apollo missions. Mapping the lunar surface was a high priority during Apollo 15, 16, and 17. Mounted in the service module, the mapping camera captured high-resolution images of the Moon as the spacecraft orbited. While returning to Earth, command module pilots performed spacewalks to retrieve the film canisters, mounted on the right side of the camera.
This flight backup, available for those missions if the installed cameras were damaged or malfunctioned before launch, is the best surviving example of the Fairchild-built camera. The flown versions remained in the service modules, which burned up when they reentered the Earth's atmosphere.
This camera was transferred from NASA to the Museum in 1978.
California businessman Dennis Tito wore this Sokol KV-2 spacesuit when he became the first tourist in space on April 28, 2001. After months of training and preparation in Moscow and at the Cosmonaut Flight Training Center in Star City, Russia, Tito was launched aboard the Soyuz TM-32 from Baikonur, Kazakhstan, and spent six days in the International Space Station. He paid the Russians a reported $20 million for this adventure.
The Sokol ("Falcon") spacesuit was designed in the early 1970s to protect cosmonauts during launch, landing, and emergencies. The plugs and tubes extending from the suit connect to life-support systems built into the Soyuz spacecraft. Mr. Tito donated his suit to the Museum in 2003.
This fuel cell is a cutaway version of the electric-power generating device used on the two-astronaut Gemini spacecraft during ten missions in 1965-66. A fuel cell is like a battery, in that it uses a chemical reaction to create an electrical current. Unlike a battery, a fuel cell will continue to generate a current as long as the reactants are supplied. The Gemini fuel cell used liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen to generate electricity, with water as a byproduct. Oxygen and hydrogen molecules reacted and combined across a "proton exchange membrane," a thin permeable polymer sheet coated with a platinum catalyst.
The Gemini program pioneered the use of fuel cells in space, and this technology was subsequently used in the Apollo Service Module and the Space Shuttle Orbiter. General Electric, the manufacturer of Gemini fuel cells, gave this artifact to the Smithsonian in 1966.
Sikorsky HO5S-1
The HO5S-1 served as the Marine Corps’ primary medical evacuation helicopter in the final year of the Korean War. Able to carry wounded on internally-mounted litters with an attendant, it was an improvement over other light utility helicopters that required the wounded to ride outside of the fuselage while exposed to harsh conditions. The HO5S-1 featured an opening front bubble for easy access, a rear-mounted (and severely underpowered) engine configured to maximize internal carrying capacity and offset rotor blade flapping hinges to improve control and stability, which made it ideal for night flying.
In July 1952, this HO5S-1, one of only a handful of surviving Korean War helicopters, was one of the first examples delivered to Observation Squadron VMO-6, which performed the majority of helicopter-borne medical evacuations for wounded Marines in Korea, evacuating over 5,000 seriously wounded personnel. Postwar, it served with Orlando Helicopter Airways as an air taxi and crop sprayer, as well as a platform to test an all-electric drive system.

In this aircraft, H. Ross Perot Jr. and J. Coburn completed the first round-the-world flight by helicopter. They departed Dallas, Texas, on September 1, 1982, and returned 29 days later after flying over 26 countries. They flew an average of eight and a half hours a day, refueled 56 times, and encountered no major mechanical problems along the way.
Powered by an Allison 250-C28B turbine engine, the LongRanger is a typical helicopter built for business and utility use. The Spirit of Texas was modified for its round-the-world trip. Nonessential items were removed and an extra fuel tank was added, along with special safety, communication, and navigation equipment. The aircraft was painted bright colors to enhance its visibility.
Sir Frank Whittle's jet aircraft engine was patented in 1932, and Power Jets, Ltd. formed in 1936. The Whittle Unit bench test engine first ran on April 12, 1937. In 1939, the British Air Ministry placed a contract for the W.1 engine to be flight tested on the new Gloster E.28/39 aircraft. During taxiing tests, the W.1X non-airworthy engine unofficially became the first British turbojet to be airborne when the E.28/39 made short, straight hops. The W.1 flew officially in the E.28/39 on May 15, 1941.
The W.1X and drawings of the W.2B production engine were delivered to the General Electric Company on October 1, 1941. GE's improved and uprated version, the IA, powered the first U.S. jet aircraft, the Bell XP-59A Airacomet on October 2, 1942. At the end of its useful life, the W.1X was returned to England. On November 8, 1949, the W.1X was presented to the Smithsonian by Power Jets, Ltd.
This boomerang, an example of the "first aerodynamic shape conceived by man," was presented in 1969 to NASA astronaut Michael Collins by the Australian Television Network Channel 7 in celebration of the success of the Apollo 11 Moon landing that July. After Apollo 11, Collins, the command module pilot, and his two crewmates, the first moonwalkers Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, embarked on a 45-day world tour. Commemorative items like this one, prepared by organizations, companies, or nations, provided a tangible demonstration of the enthusiasm for the first Moon landing.
Collins, later the director of the National Air and Space Museum and an undersecretary of the Smithsonian Instituion, gave the boomerang to the National Collection in 1986.
This is a nozzle from a 1-inch solid fuel rocket which U.S. rocket pioneer Robert H. Goddard made during 1917-1918 for the U.S. Army as a weapon during World War I. The spiral grooves on the nozzle caused the rocket to rotate during its flight thereby helping to counteract deviations in its flight path and making it more stable in its flight.
A trial was later undertaken at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Grounds, Aberdeen, Maryland, on 6 November 1918. However, the following day the armistice was signed that ended the war as well as the Army's interest in this project. In 1921 Goddard switched to liquid propellants. This nozzle was donated to the Smithsonian by the Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics in 1985.
Among the most successful early engines marketed in the United States were those designed and built by aviation pioneer and inventor Glenn Curtiss. Early Curtiss engines were designed to power motorcycles. The first Curtiss aircraft engines were air cooled but, to achieve higher power, Curtiss began to develop liquid-cooled engines.
With the advent of World War I, Curtiss concentrated its production on the famous 67 kW (90 hp) OX-5 engine which powered the JN-4D “Jenny” trainer aircraft. The OXX-6 engine was an improved version of the OX-5. Differences from the OX-5 included two magnetos (instead of one) for greater dependability and a slightly larger cylinder bore giving an additional 7.5 kW (10 horsepower). During World War I, the OXX-6 was used on such Curtiss aircraft as the Model N9 hydroplane. Together, the OX-5 and OXX-6 were the most extensively used American-built engines during World War I and in the following decade.
Dr. Hugo Junkers started development of his Diesel aircraft engines in a small factory at Dessau, Germany in 1911. His early engines functioned on the two-stroke cycle principle with piston-controlled parts, as did his later Junkers Jumo Diesels. Among the advantages of later, refined Diesel aircraft engines were lower specific fuel consumption (for long-range applications), lower exhaust gas temperature (for exhaust-driven supercharger installations), and reduced fire hazard as compared to conventional reciprocating aircraft engines.
The Jumo 207 was a Jumo 205 with a turbo-supercharger. A Diesel operating on a two-stroke cycle, it incorporated six cylinders and 12 opposed pistons (i.e. 2 per cylinder) in an in-line, liquid-cooled configuration. The Jumo 207 could maintain its sea-level rated power to approximately 7,900 m (26,000 ft.). The Jumo 207 A and B powered the Junkers Ju 86 P and R reconnaissance/bomber aircraft that had an absolute ceiling of approximately 15,000 m (49,000 ft.).
During World War I several types of aircraft engines were designed and developed by the Royal Aircraft Factory, a government facility located in Farnborough, England, previously known as the HM Balloon Factory. The first of these was the RAF-1, development which began in 1913. It was an air-cooled V-8 engine based on the Renault V-8, but with larger cylinders. The design was improved in 1914 as the RAF-1a. A total of 2,860 RAF-1a engines were built between August 1914 and December 1918.
The RAF-1a powered the: Airco D.H.6; Armstrong Whitworth F.K.2/F.K.3; Avro 504K; Boulton & Paul P.6 and P.9; de Havilland D.H.51; and Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c/d/e, B.E.9. and S.E.5 aircraft.
William Piper and the Piper Aircraft Corporation board of directors anointed this Cub, completed on November 2, 1937, as the first official Piper J-2 and flew it as the company plane until April 1939.The tandem two-place J-2 is the transition model of stable and economical Cub light aircraft that made flying easy to learn and afford. The J-2 cost $1,470 or could be rented for $10 an hour. A total of 1,207 Taylor and Piper J-2 Cubs were built from 1935 to 1938.
This Cub had a succession of owners. It was restored by Hal Goff of Aero Enterprises of Pittsburgh in 1976, then flown to Lock Haven where former Piper Cub engineer Walter Jamoneau piloted it. Lefferts Mabie Jr. of Pensacola, Florida, acquired it from yet another owner in 1981 and donated it to the Museum in 1984.
This first metal and ground-adjustable-pitch propeller was designed and built by Stuart Bastow, an electrical sign contractor, and Victor Pagé, a mechanical engineer, for the dirigible Rhode Island in 1910. Bastow bought a bamboo and fabric propeller and the propulsion system from Capt. Thomas Scott Baldwin's California Arrow. Pagé, unsatisfied, suggested constructing a propeller from aluminum, then a relatively new, but proven material, because of its light weight and strength.
The aluminum blades were riveted to steel tubing connected through a threaded joint to a central aluminum hub, and retained an aerodynamic shape while the steel tubing provided the required strength to offset centrifugal force. Not knowing which pitch setting would be best for the dirigible, except through trial-and-error, they designed the propeller to be adjustable on the ground; resulting in the earliest American attempt at multipiece construction that facilitated deliberate pitch variation. This propeller emerged unscathed during several forced landings, which indicated its inherent performance and durability benefits.
"Maggie" carried this stopwatch in a black velvet pouch around her neck.
On May 29, 1951, Capt. Charles F. Blair flew Excalibur III from Norway across the North Pole to Alaska in a record-setting 10½ hours. Using a system of carefully plotted "sun lines" he developed, Blair was able to navigate with precision where conventional magnetic compasses often failed. Four months earlier, he had flown Excalibur III from New York to London in less than 8 hours, breaking the existing mark by over an hour.
Excalibur III first belonged to famed aviator A. Paul Mantz, who added extra fuel tanks for long-distance racing to this standard P-51C fighter. With it Mantz won the 1946 and 1947 Bendix air race and set a transcontinental speed record in 1947 when the airplane was named Blaze of Noon. Blair purchased it from Mantz in 1949 and renamed it Excalibur III, after the Sikorsky VS-44 flying boat he flew for American Export Airlines.
The Aeronca C-2 was the first truly light airplane certified by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of Aeronautics and produced in substantial numbers in the United States. Safe, economical, and easy to fly, this delightful but unassuming monoplane changed the face of aviation by tapping a new market, that of private aircraft ownership. This Aeronca is the production prototype; it first flew on October 20, 1929.
The single-seat Aeronca C-2 and the two-seat C-3 capitalized on the enthusiasm of the post-Lindbergh flight era by offering small and affordable designs to the general public. During the depression, while many larger aircraft proved to be too expensive to operate, the Aeronca C-2 sold for under $1,300 and could be rented for only $4.00 an hour. This Aeronca flew for 10 years with several owners.
This Palapa B1 Satellite medal was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. Palapa is the name for a series of communication satellites owned by Indosat, an Indonesian telecommunication company. The B1 was deployed in 1983 during STS-7, the space shuttle mission in which Ride became the first American woman in space.
A physicist with a Ph.D., Ride joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the medal to the Museum in 2013.
The Boeing P-26A of the mid-to-late 1930s introduced the concept of the high-performance, all-metal monoplane fighter design, which would become standard during World War II. A radical departure from wood-and-fabric biplanes, the Peashooter nonetheless retained an open cockpit, fixed landing gear, and external wing bracing.
Most P-26As stationed overseas were eventually sold to the Philippines or assigned to the Panama Canal Department Air Force, a branch of the U.S. Army Air Corps. Several went to China and one to Spain. This one was based at Selfridge Field in Michigan and Fairfield Air Depot in Ohio between its acceptance by the U.S. Army Air Corps in 1934 and its transfer to the Canal Zone in 1938. It was given to Guatemala in 1942 and flew in the Guatemalan air force until 1954. Guatemala donated it to the Smithsonian in 1957.
From 1931 to 1953, Andy Stinis performed skywriting in this airplane for Pepsi-Cola. During those years, skywriting with smoke was a premier form of advertising, and Pepsi-Cola used it more than any other company. Pepsi-Cola acquired the airplane in 1973 and used it for air show and advertising duty until retiring it in 2000. Peggy Davies and Suzanne Oliver, the world's only active female skywriters since 1977, performed in it.
The Pepsi Skywriter is one of more than 1,200 Travel Air open-cockpit biplanes built between 1925 and 1930. Popular and rugged, Travel Airs earned their keep as utility workhorses and record breakers. The design was the first success for three giants of the general aviation industry, Lloyd Stearman, Walter Beech, and Clyde Cessna, who in 1925 established the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita, Kansas.
The Packard Motor Car Company produced the world’s first quantity-production 12-cylinder automobile in in 1916, and belief in that engine carried over to aviation in the following year. Development of the Packard X, basically two Model 1500s sharing one crank-shaft, began about 1920. A few years later, under a Navy contract, Packard built two 1A-2775 engines. The first was test flown for the 1927 Schneider Trophy race by Al Williams in a Kirkham racer, but did not compete. Williams later set an unofficial speed record of 515 kilometers (322 miles) per hour in the racer in 1927.
For the 1929 Schneider Trophy race, Williams modified the racer into a monoplane, which was designated the Mercury Racer. The aircraft was too heavy, so a second, more powerful engine was prepared. Super-charged and rated at 1,119 kW (1,500) horsepower, it was the most powerful aircraft engine in the world. However, the Navy withdrew its support, and the airplane did not race.
Soviet model makers built this spacecraft based on the designs and notes of Konstantin Tsiolkovsky. Late in his life, much of Tsiolkovsky's theoretical work focused on ideas about transporting humans into space on board rockets. Although this model, reflecting the scientist's ideas, grossly overestimates the living space available on board a rocket, it does convey a sophisticated understanding of the physical constraints of space travel for that time. Among Tsiolkovsky's concerns were the effects of acceleration and weightlessness on the human body.

This small spoon was used by Command Module Pilot Michael Collins for eating during the Apollo 11 mission in July, 1969. It is constructed of stainless steel, and was part of his Personal Preference Kit.
Donated to the National Air and Space Museum by Michael Collins in 1984
De Havilland originally designed the Chipmunk after World War II as a primary trainer to replace the venerable Tiger Moth. Among the tens of thousands of pilots who trained in or flew the Chipmunk for pleasure was veteran aerobatic and movie pilot Art Scholl. He flew his Pennzoil Special at air shows throughout the 1970s and early '80s, thrilling audiences with his skill and showmanship and proving that the design was a top-notch aerobatic aircraft.
Art Scholl purchased the DHC-1A in 1968. He modified it to a single-seat airplane with a shorter wingspan and larger vertical fin and rudder, and made other changes to improve its performance. Scholl was a three-time member of the U.S. Aerobatic Team, an air racer, and a movie and television stunt pilot. At air shows, he often flew with his dog Aileron on his shoulder or taxied with him standing on the wing.
This is a one piece "Sidcot" flying suit 1940 Pattern. The suit was worn by pilots in Britain’s Royal Air Force during World War II. The suit is a redevelopment of the original Sidcot suit from World War I. The suit was first introduced in 1930 and was continually redeveloped until the suit was retired after the war.
This flying suit was transferred to the museum by the Royal Air Force Museum and there is no known information about who wore the suit.

This is a 1/140 scale model of one of the three, 64 m (210 ft) Deep Space Network Antennas. Beginning in 1958, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory of Pasadena, California contracted for the construction of three 26 m (85 ft) antennas, spaced approximately 120 degrees longitude apart, to provide continuous coverage of deep space. Stations were established in California, Australia, and Spain. Beginning in 1962, NASA and JPL began design and construction of three larger antennas. This is a scale model of one of those.
NASA transferred this model to the Museum in 1982.
The Loki-Dart was the sounding rocket version of the Loki surface-to-air spin-stabilized missile briefly used as a barrage weapon by the U.S. Army in 1949. The Loki is small, light, but powerful for its size and very inexpensive. It was therefore adapted by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and State University of Iowa for upper-atmospheric sounding and meteorological work.
Loki-Darts were designed to measure temperature and wind velocity up to a height of 65 kilometers (40 miles). The Loki burned out at a 1,524-meter (5,000 feet) altitude, then dropped off while the Dart inert payload section continued on a ballistic trajectory up to peak altitude and conducted its measurements. This object was donated to the Smithsonian in 1975 by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center.
Charles A. Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, purchased this Lockheed Sirius airplane in 1929 for $22,825. Designed by Gerald Vultee and Jack Northrop, the Sirius was a low-wing monoplane with the same monocoque (molded shell) fuselage as the popular Lockheed Vega. Originally an open-cockpit landplane, the Lindberghs' Sirius was modified with a sliding canopy and Edo floats for their two overwater journeys in 1931 and 1933.
The Lindberghs set a coast-to-coast speed record in the Sirius on April 20, 1930, but its most significant flights were in 1931 and 1933. In 1931 the Lindberghs flew to the Orient, proving the viability of traveling from the West to the Far East via the Great Circle route to the North. In 1933 they flew survey flights across the North and South Atlantic to gather information for planning commercial air routes. During their 1933 trip a Greenland Eskimo boy gave the Sirius its nickname: "Tingmissartoq"-"One who flies like a big bird."
Upon returning from their transatlantic trip in late 1933, the Lindberghs donated the "Tingmissartoq" to the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. It was displayed in the Hall of Ocean Life until 1955, when it was sent to the United States Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio. After deciding that the Lindberghs' plane did not really represent the Air Force, the Air Force Museum transferred it to the Smithsonian Institution's Air Museum in 1959.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
In the mid-1940s, Boeing engineers conducted research to become familiar with gas turbines, but it became apparent that the research engines were significant in themselves. First engine run was the 667 N (150 lb) thrust Model 500 turbojet, closely followed by the 119 kw (160 shp) Model 502 turboprop. Because no applications materialized for the turbojet, efforts were focused on the Model 502, initially developed as a turboprop and later as the more widely used turboshaft engine, first delivered in 1949.
In late-1951, a Model 502 powered Kaman K-225 helicopter became the world's first gas turbine-powered helicopter, and, in late-1952, a Model 502 powered Cessna XL-19B Bird Dog became the world's first turboprop-powered light aircraft.
By the mid-1960s, significant power and reliability improvements produced the Model 502-10VC, the first U.S. turbine engine in the 149 to 224 kw (200 to 300 shp) range to receive an approved 150-hour qualification. This artifact powered the Gyrodyne QH-50C (DSN-3) drone helicopter.
During his three-orbit flight on February 20, 1962, John Glenn used this photometer/rangefinder to measure the airglow layer around the Earth. Sometimes called a Voasmeter photometer - after Robert Voas, who trained early astronauts for NASA - the device allowed Glenn to look through the filter and make measurements with the small dial. Information could be gathered from these observations on the intensity of both sunlight and starlight.
Glenn was the first astronaut to use hand-held cameras in space and performed some simple scientific experiments and Earth observations during his short flight. For photography, he carried a modified Leica camera for standard black and white images and an Ansco Autoset camera - modified with ultraviolet film- aboard the spacecraft. Other devices such as a rangefinder and this photometer were used in making astronomical observations which were continued with better equipment on successive Mercury missions.
NASA transferred this rangefinder to the Museum along with all other Friendship 7 equipment in 1967.
The Curtiss JN-4D is almost synonymous with American aviation in the 1920s. The Jenny, as it was affectionately called, appeared in 1917. Heretofore having only produced pusher aircraft, Glenn Curtiss hired an experienced European designer to lead the new project named B. Douglas Thomas, who had worked for Avro and Sopwith in England. The Jenny performed admirably as a trainer for the U.S. Air Service during World War I, but its more significant role in aviation history was as a barnstorming and mail-carrying airplane in the 1920s. Large numbers of relatively inexpensive war surplus Jennys were available in the United States after 1918. Its affordability, ease of operation, and versatility made the Jenny the signature airplane of the barnstorming era. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918 directly from the U.S. War Department. It is one of the finest remaining examples of this truly classic airplane.
About the middle of 1923, the U.S. Navy signed a contract with Wright Aeronautical for three large air-cooled engine designs, which were to be built successively. The first of these, based on a design proposed earlier to the U.S. Army by Charles Lawrance, was known as the P-1, and was the direct forerunner of the highly successful Wright Cyclone series of engines. In order to reduce aerodynamic drag, its design was limited to a frontal area no greater than that of the Navy's Lawrance J engine, despite the fact that the P-1 had twice the displacement.
The P-1 was tested extensively in 1924 in a Douglas DT-2 aircraft, and flown successfully in the Navy Douglas DT-6 and Boeing aircraft. However, magnesium alloy castings, being used for the first time, failed in endurance tests. The P-1 was then discontinued in favor of the larger P-2, which added Heron-type cylinders and a supercharger.
The Apollo 11 Command Module, "Columbia," was the living quarters for the three-person crew during most of the first crewed lunar landing mission in July 1969. On July 16, 1969, Neil Armstrong, Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin and Michael Collins were launched from Cape Kennedy atop a Saturn V rocket. This Command Module, no. 107, manufactured by North American Rockwell, was one of three parts of the complete Apollo spacecraft. The other two parts were the Service Module and the Lunar Module, nicknamed "Eagle." The Service Module contained the main spacecraft propulsion system and consumables while the Lunar Module was the two-person craft used by Armstrong and Aldrin to descend to the Moon's surface on July 20. The Command Module is the only portion of the spacecraft to return to Earth.
It was physically transferred to the Smithsonian in 1971 following a NASA-sponsored tour of American cities. The Apollo CM Columbia has been designated a "Milestone of Flight" by the Museum.
On December 14, 1962, useful scientific information was radioed to Earth from the vicinity of another planet for the first time. The unmanned Mariner 2 spacecraft, with its six scientific instruments, passed within 34,800 kilometers (21,600 miles) of Venus. Mariner 2 indicated that Venus is very hot and has no measurable magnetic fields or radiation belts. On the way to Venus, Mariner 2's instruments detected and measured the radiation, magnetic fields, and dust of interplanetary space.
Contact with Mariner 2 was lost on January 2, 1963; it is now in orbit around the Sun. The spacecraft on display was constructed from test components by engineers from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
Designed by Harold E. Morehouse, a preeminent light aircraft engine designer, this was the first successful U.S. inverted air-cooled engine designed for that aircraft type. An important advantage of the inverted design is improved pilot visibility.
The prototype engine, designated Rover L-236, was assembled in 1928, type certificated in 1929 at a rating of 41 kW (55 shp), and flight tested on a British Avro Avian. In 1929, work also began on the improved and higher powered, Model L-267, production version, which was type certificated in 1930. The primary aircraft applications of the L-267 were the Driggs Skylark and Fairchild 22. Approximately 80 to 90 Rover L-267 engines were built before the depression of the early 1930s necessitated a complete production halt in 1932. A legacy of the L-267 was its influence on the design of other U.S. and European inverted, air-cooled engines.
Following his first Thompson Trophy victory in 1934, famed racing pilot Roscoe Turner contracted with the Lawrence W. Brown Aircraft Company to build a new racing aircraft. Designed by Turner and engineered by University of Minnesota professor Howard Barlow, the Turner racer was completed in mid-1936. Following flight tests, Matty Laird extensively redesigned the aircraft and added a larger wing and flaps.
Known as the Laird Turner LTR-14 and later the Turner RT-14, the modified racer placed third in the 1937 Thompson Trophy event at the National Air Races and won the 1938 and 1939 contests. With this aircraft, Turner became the only three-time winner of the Thompson Trophy. In 1939 the aircraft was sponsored by Champion Spark Plugs and therefore carried the name "Miss Champion" on its fuselage.
The Pershing II was a mobile, intermediate-range ballistic missile deployed by the U.S. Army at American bases in West Germany beginning in 1983. It was aimed at targets in the western Soviet Union. Each Pershing II carried a single, variable-yield thermonuclear warhead with an explosive force equivalent to 5-50 kilotons of TNT. Under the terms of the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union, all Pershing IIs and their support equipment were removed from the inventory and rendered inoperable. This missile is a trainer, but its dimensions and weight are identical to an operational Pershing II. It was built by Martin Marietta and transferred by the Army Missile Command to NASM in 1990.
This is a BS-212 Anton counter shell converted to a UV corona lamp. This was used during the 1950's for field checking the sensitivity of UV detectors used in Naval Research Laboratory programs. This artifact is part of a collection of high energy detectors from the Naval Research Laboratory (see A19880001000-19880017000).
It was transferred to NASM in 1987 and is currently stored at the Garber facility.
The Pitcairn PA-5 Mailwing was designed to carry air mail along the routes of the eastern United States. Efficient and economical, it helped build the route structure for what would ultimately become Eastern Air Lines.
The Mailwing NC-2895 was built in 1927 and was the prototype for a series of Pitcairn mail planes. It combined a square-steel-tube fuselage with wooden wings, both covered by fabric. After it became obsolete as a mail plane, this airplane served several private owners, survived a crash, and saw use as a crop-duster.
It was repurchased by employees of Eastern Air Lines, restored, and presented to company president Capt. Edward V. Rickenbacker, who later donated it to the Museum. The plane was restored in 1975 by veteran Eastern pilot Capt. Joseph Toth.
Test pilots at Grob-Werke GmbH & Company KG in Germany first flew the Grob 102 Standard Astir III late in 1980. The Standard Astir III is one of several models that the Grob company designed specifically to conform to the international Standard Class category of competitive sailplanes adopted in 1958. On February 17, 1986, Robert Harris flew this Grob 102 Standard Astir III and set a world altitude record of 14,899 m (49,009 ft).
On June 4, 1997, Robert Harris and his wife, Susan Rothermund, donated the Grob 102 to the National Air and Space Museum.
The Allison XV-1710-1 (V-1710-A2) was the first V-1710 engine built for the Army Air Corps, following the success of the Navy’s GV-1710-A model. The Air Corps ordered an engineering prototype in March 1932, and after initial testing by Allison, it was delivered for experimental tests to the Air Corps at Wright Field in July 1933, with the first production engine delivered in February 1935. In that same period, Allison became a division of General Motors.
The V-1710 was the only U.S. liquid-cooled production engine of World War II. Ultimately, more than 47,000 V-1710s were built in 57 different versions. During World War II, V-1710s powered various models of the Lockheed P-38, Curtiss P-40, Bell P-39 and P-63, and North American P-51 fighter aircraft. Constant development, including use of a turbocharger, increased the rated take-off power to as high as 1,715 kW (2,300 hp) following World War II.
The Hughes H-1 racer, designed by Howard Hughes and Richard Palmer and built by Glenn Odekirk, was developed to be the fastest landplane in the world. On September 13, 1935, Hughes achieved this design goal by flying the H-1 to a new world speed record of 567 kilometers (352 miles) per hour at Santa Ana, California. Also known as the Hughes 1B, the H-1 was designed with two sets of wings: a short set with a span of 7.6 meters (25 feet) for speed record flight, and a long set with a span of 9.2 meters (31 feet, 9 inches) for transcontinental flight. The aircraft as it is exhibited here is equipped with the long set.
Hughes broke the transcontinental U.S. speed record in the H-l on January 19, 1937, flying from Los Angeles to Newark, New Jersey, in 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds. His average speed for the 4,000-kilometer (2,490-mile) flight was 535 kilometers (332 miles) per hour.
Breitling Orbiter 3
Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones guided the balloon Breitling Orbiter 3 up and away from the Swiss Alpine village of Chateau d'Oex at 8:05, GMT, 1March 1999. They landed in the Egyptian desert 19 days, 21 hours and 55 minutes later (21 March 1999), having traveled a distance of over 29,000 miles and completed the first non-stop flight around the world with a free balloon.
The success of Breitling Orbiter 3 was based on the lessons learned during two previous attempts to fly around the globe in 1997 (Breitling Orbiter) and 1998 (Breitling Orbiter 2). That experience enabled the Breitling team to develop trustworthy technical systems and a basic strategy that called for Piccard and Jones to pilot their balloon to altitudes of over 30,000 feet, where jet stream winds would drive it across the Pacific at speeds of over 100 miles per hour.
Breitling Orbiter 3 was designed and built by Cameron Balloons, of Bristol, England. When fully inflated it stands 180 feet (55 meters) tall. The envelope is constructed of a nylon fabric welded to a helium-tight membrane covered with an outer protective skin that is coated with aluminum on both sides to provide improved thermal control. The shape and special features of the envelope were designed to insure maximum temperature stability in order to conserve helium and reduce propane consumption.
The envelope is a Rozier design, combining the advantages of helium and hot air technologies to create a balloon capable of extended flights. A large cell of helium is placed within a specially designed hot air balloon. Six propane-fed burners warm the helium at night, while a system of insulation and vents reduce the effect of solar heating during the day. The result is a balloon that remains at a fairly constant altitude, conserving helium and making it possible to remain aloft for extended periods. The propane gas that fueled the six burners of Breitling Orbiter 3 was contained in 28 titanium cylinders mounted in two rows along the sides of the gondola.
Their epic journey was applauded as one of the great aviation adventures of the century. Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain spoke for millions around the world in a special message to the balloonists: "The news of your splendid achievement has delighted us all."
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
The Curtiss-Wright CW-1 Junior was a moderately priced sport aircraft produced before the Depression for the general public. Its affordability, short field capability, sturdy construction, low handling speed, and good visibility made it an easy and safe plane to fly. The Junior soon became the most popular flivver-type airplane of the early 1930s and represents a significant milestone in the "everyman" aircraft movement of the period.
Karl H. White, Walter Beech, and H. Lloyd Child designed and produced the Skeeter, later renamed the Junior, which was powered by a 3-cylinder 45 hp Szekely SR-3-O engine. The Museum's aircraft has a rich background of many years on the air show circuit performing the "Flying Farmer" routine in which a "bystander" attempts to fly the plane with comical but safe results. It was donated to the Museum in 1959.
Virtually unknown outside Italy, the C.202 Folgore was the best fighter airplane fielded in significant numbers by the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Royal Air Force or RA) during World War II. This airplane demonstrated that Italy could design and build fighter aircraft to world-class standards. Aeronautica Macchi S. p. A. designed and built the Folgore (Lightning), which was based on an earlier Macchi design powered by a radial engine, the C.200 Saeta (Thunderbolt). To create the Folgore, Macchi's chief of design, Mario Castoldi, adapted the Saeta airframe to the German Daimler-Benz DB 601 liquid-cooled engine. Italy was a significant air-faring nation during the mid-1930s but its aviation industry began to lag late in the decade, particularly in engine development. No indigenous, in-line powerplant of sufficient power was available when the war started so early in 1940 Macchi had to import the German engine as a private venture. The results were impressive. Flat out, the Folgore was almost 97 kph (60 mph) faster than the Saeta's speed of 502 kph (312 mph).
Bill Bennett founded Delta Wing Kites and Gliders in 1969 to build and market boat-towed kites, such as the Delta Wing Model 162 (see NASM collection), flown by water skiers. Bennett fitted these gliders with flexible wings evaluated at NASA by Francis M. Rogallo. Hang gliders equipped with Rogallo wings spread around the world because they flew reasonably well, cost little to build, and were easy to transport. By the late 1970s, Bennett had started to modify the early Rogallo wing designs to improve safety and performance. Skilled pilots flying these new gliders, including the Phoenix and Mariah series (see NASM collection), could perform loops and wingovers.
In 1980, Bennett introduced the Viper with a stiffer and more aerodynamically efficient high-aspect ratio wing structure but without a significant increase in weight. He designed the Viper to appeal to pilots who had earned a 'Hang 3' glider pilot classification, an advanced skill rating. The lower wing fabric now extended from the leading edge more than half-way to the trailing edge and covered 57 percent of the lower wing surface area. Bennett devised new methods to stiffen the leading edge and he abandoned the cumbersome, drag-inducing leading edge ‘deflexor’ cables seen on earlier models such as the Phoenix VI and VI.B (see NASM collection). Bennett also omitted the drooped wingtips seen on the Delta Wing Mariah (see NASM collection). The Viper flew with other modifications including a new, lighter sail material, and a split keel. Despite all these changes, a pilot could assemble the Viper as rapidly and easily as pervious Bennett designs. The designation '175' refers to the area of the wing in square feet. Bennett sold the Viper in 1981 for $1,795.
Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, took this receiver and other radio equipment on their 1931 flight to the Orient and 1933 survey flights across the North and South Atlantic. Because they were flying over vast stretches of unchartered territory in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia during their 1931 flight and Greenland, Africa, and Brazil during their 1933 flight, the Lindberghs relied on radio and navigation equipment to help them find their remote destinations.
Anne, who served as co-pilot, operated all of the radio equipment during the Lindberghs' two trans-global flights, performing an impressive daily workload, and set a telegraph transmission distance record. Prior to the 1931 flight she worked hard to learn Morse code and earn her radio operator's license. She eventually became skilled at using complex radio equipment such as this receiver, but at first she felt she needed four hands to perform "acrobatics:" two to tune the dials, one to write down the incoming message, and one to hold her pad of paper. During the Lindberghs' 1933 flight, a Pan American radio operator remarked, "My God, she got it!" after Anne successfully received his one-hundred and fifty word message through heavy static.
Charles Lawrance started his designs for an air-cooled engine in 1915. In 1921, Lawrance designed his first engine for a U.S. Navy contract, which wanted a compact lightweight engine not plagued with water leakage problems. Following a Navy encouraged merger with Wright, the Lawrance engine progressed through design stages, as the Wright Whirlwind J-3, J-4, J-5, and J-6 series. The most famous of these was the J-5, used by Lindbergh.
J-4 engines powered such aircraft as the Fairchild FC-1 and FC-2, Fokker Universal, Laird Commercial LC-B200, Stearman C2B and C3B, and Stinson Detroiter SB-1. When introduced in 1925, the J-4 was adopted by the Navy as a stock power plant. A total of 190 J-4 engines were built.
In 1926, Admiral Richard Byrd and Floyd Bennett made a flight from Spitzbergen, Norway over the North Pole and back. This was the first airplane flight over the Pole, and used the J-4B engine in a Fokker F-VII Tri-motor.
Lt. Lowell Smith took this No. 1A Autographic Kodak Junior folding camera on the 1924 Douglas World Cruiser "Chicago" Round the World Flight. Using "Autographic" film and a stylus, the user could write data on the negative via carbon paper fit inbetween the film and the film backing.
Marc Birkigt, an inventor of Swiss origin, developed Hispano-Suiza (meaning Spanish-Swiss) engines, and first manufactured them in Barcelona for use in automobiles. Hisso engines were very successful and, to save weight, featured innovative cast-aluminum cylinder construction with internal water passages and screwed-in steel sleeves. Particularly to meet demand in World War I required licensing of Hisso aircraft engine manufacturing in France, England and the U.S by Wright-Martin, later the Wright Aeronautical Corporation.
Hispano-Suiza introduced its 12Y series of engines in 1932. The 12 cylinders were arranged in a V at 60 degrees and all models had propeller reduction gears with provision to fire a cannon through the hub, with the cannon mounted on the V. Centrifugal superchargers mounted at the rear of the engine delivered air to six carburetors, with three attached to the outside of each block. This type of engine powered the Latecoere 298, Morane-Saulnier 406, and Arsenal VG-31 and VG-33.
Timers like this were used by astronauts to time experiments and other events during the Skylab missions (1973-1974). This timer is a flight-qualified backup, transferred from NASA and installed in the Skylab orbital workshop on display in the Museum. It has the "Accutron" movement developed by Bulova for wristwatches, on/off switches for the timer and tone, and a small amplifier.
American rocket pioneer Dr. Robert H. Goddard launched the Hoopskirt rocket on December 26, 1928, near Worcester, Massachusetts. It was so-named because it resembled a hoopskirt, a ladies’ fashion of the late 19th century. Goddard made no effort to build the rocket as a streamlined vehicle. He only wanted to test the operation of his rocket motor and make the vehicle as light as possible.
Goddard attempted to launch it on 18 July 1928, but the rocket jammed in the launch tower. Finally on 26 December 1928, on the fourth try, the Hoopskirt cleared the tower and flew for 3.2 seconds, covering a distance of 204.5 feet (62 m). It was Goddard's third liquid-fuel rocket flight. His first was on 16 March 1926. The rocket was donated to the Smithsonian by Mrs. Robert H. Goddard in 1959 and is a reconstruction, as the flimsy structure was smashed by the flight.
The Union Gas Engine Company of Oakland, California began producing marine engines in 1885, and started experimental construction of an aircraft engine in 1915. In 1917, under Army and Navy supervision, that engine, with a pusher propeller, was the first to pass the U.S. government 50-hour test, which consisted of eight full throttle, six hour runs on consecutive days, followed by a tilting test.
Union engines were built primarily for use in lighter-than-air craft. A Union engine of this type powered a non-stop record 1,760 km (1,100 mile) flight of 25 hours from New York to Newfoundland on the U.S.N. Airship C-5 in 1919, an apparent trial for a later unaccomplished trans-Atlantic flight.
This "ERA is for Everyone" button was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. The Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) was introduced to Congress for the first time in 1923, and passed both houses of Congress in 1972. It failed, however, to be ratified by the necessary number of states by the extended deadline of June 1982. Ride followed the ERA campaign, and would stop patronizing companies if she knew that they did not support the ERA. When Ride became the first American woman in space during the STS-7 mission of 1983, her exemplary performance as a Mission Specialist challenged perceptions of women as the "weaker sex."
A physicist with a Ph.D., Ride joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the button to the Museum in 2013.
This small music box portrays the first artificial satellite of the Earth, Sputnik, in orbit around the Earth. A stylized rendition of the satellite is mounted on a round base that represents the globe. On the base is inscribed the date October 4, 1957 (the launch of Sputnik), and the letters CCCP (Cyrillic letters for USSR). When wound, the music box plays a short tune, followed by beeps that represent the characteristic beeps of the satellite that could be heard by amateur radio operators throughout the world during the last three months of 1957. This object was added to the national collection for its significance to the cultural and psychological impact of the Sputnik launch. Although the satellite itself was a very simple one, carrying only basic instruments for measuring temperature and pressure, and a radio transmitter, its impact on world politics, military affairs, and science and technology was profound. The launch of Sputnik transported the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union to a new arena and began the Space Race.
A private collector, who purchased the music box while on a trip to the Soviet Union in 1964, donated the Sputnik Music box to the museum in 1985. The object is 6 inches, has a base that is 5 inches diameter, and is made of plastic. Sputnik is silver, the stand is clear plastic and the base is blue with gold lettering.
The NC-3 aircrew used this pump to move coolant or fuel in the event of an in-flight mechanical breakdown.
The Large Format Camera (LFC) flew on a Space Shuttle mission in 1984, photographing large swaths of the Earth's surface.
Originally developed for use in high-altitude aircraft, the camera took its name from its large format film (23 x 46 cm). This film size, in combination with the camera's special optics, allowed the LFC to capture in a single frame more than 60,000 square kilometers (23,400 square miles) with enough resolution to distinguish buildings and roads. The images helped in creating precise, detailed maps and aided in geological analysis, environmental monitoring, and urban planning.
The museum's artifact is a model of the camera and associated electronics, but includes real optics, which can be seen through a cutaway. ITEK Corporation donated the model to the Museum in 1985.
This a 1:5 scale model of the support systems module of the Hubble Space Telescope. It was fabricated by the Lockheed Missile and Space Company, the contractor responsible for building the flight spacecraft. The model depicts the exterior shell of the spacecraft as well as the exterior assemblies required for its operation. Prominent features on the model include the light shield/aperture door and the two wing-like solar arrays which flank the main tubular assembly. This is one of four scale models of the HST in the NASM collection (see also Catalogue #s 19810041000, 19830232000,). The model was donated to NASM by the Lockheed Company in August 1983.
This is the flight spare main amplifier for the antenna apparatus carried on the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory V (OGO-V) designed to measure the energy characteristics in the radiation belts surrounding the Earth. This solid state device, which was located in the main bus of the satellite, took signals from the sensor antenna (Catalogue #19860560000). This amplifier was manufactured by the Space and Technology Group of TRW; the firm donated it to the Museum in February 1985.
OGO-V was the fifth in a series of standardized spacecraft capable of performing many related experiments that were launched during the middle 1960s. The sensor formed part of an experiment that measured the electrostatic and electromagnetic properties of the plasma ranging from the upper ionosphere to the solar wind. The flight model of the plasma wave detector was placed in orbit from Cape Kennedy on March 4, 1968. Data from this instrument provided the first evidence for the shock wave observed in the solar wind as it encounters the Earth's magnetic field, the so-called bow shock.
This life jacket was issued to John Glenn for his Friendship 7 flight in February 1962. The life jacket is the self-inflating tube-type Navy issue life jacket made of rubberized nylon. It was strapped to his chest with the convex mirror fastened to the front.
The mirror had the dual purpose of a reflecting mirror in case of mission abort when the astronaut could use the mirror to attract rescuers. The other use was for reflection of the instrument panel in order to enable the staff of Mission Control to take instrument readings.
Transferred to the National Air and Space Museum from NASA in 1967.
On December 23, 1986, Voyager completed the first nonstop, non-refueled flight around the world. Voyager, a unique aircraft constructed almost entirely of lightweight graphite-honeycomb composite materials and laden with fuel, lifted from Edwards AFB, California at 8:01:44 a.m., Pacific Standard Time, on Dec. 14 1986, and returned 9 days later at 8:05:28 a.m., Pacific Standard Time on Dec. 23, 1986. For their record-breaking flight, the pilots, Dick Rutan and Jeana Yeager, the designer, Burt Rutan, and the crew chief, Bruce Evans, earned the Collier Trophy, aviation's most prestigious award.
Voyager is the result of six years of design, construction, and development by a talented team of individuals. The aircraft was designed by Burt Rutan, Dick's brother, a well-known designer of homebuilt airplanes such as the VariViggen and VariEze and corporate aircraft such as the Beech Starship. Voyager was constructed in 18 months by Dick Rutan, Jeana Yeager, and Bruce Evans.
No reconnaissance aircraft in history has operated globally in more hostile airspace or with such complete impunity than the SR-71, the world's fastest jet-propelled aircraft. The Blackbird's performance and operational achievements placed it at the pinnacle of aviation technology developments during the Cold War.
This Blackbird accrued about 2,800 hours of flight time during 24 years of active service with the U.S. Air Force. On its last flight, March 6, 1990, Lt. Col. Ed Yeilding and Lt. Col. Joseph Vida set a speed record by flying from Los Angeles to Washington, D.C., in 1 hour, 4 minutes, and 20 seconds, averaging 3,418 kilometers (2,124 miles) per hour. At the flight's conclusion, they landed at Washington-Dulles International Airport and turned the airplane over to the Smithsonian.
No other aircraft surpasses the Mitsubishi A6M Reisen ("ree-sin," Japanese for Zero Fighter) as the symbol of Japanese air power during World War II. Mitsubishi designed the Zero fighter but co-produced the airplane with Nakajima. The two companies built more than 10,000 Zeros between March 1939 and August 1945. Design work began in 1937 when the Japanese Navy staff directed Mitsubishi and Nakajima to submit proposals for a new aircraft to replace the Mitsubishi A5M carrier fighter (Allied codename CLAUDE). Combat trials began in China during July 1940 and by fall, Zero pilots felled nearly 100 Chinese aircraft for the loss of only two Zeros to friendly fire.
We believe the A6M5 Zero Model 52 on display in the National Air and Space Museum came from a group of Japanese aircraft captured on Saipan Island in April 1944. Navy personnel removed 12 late-model Zeros from the island and sent them to the United States for evaluation. The earliest records pertaining to the Museum's Zero show that it was evaluated in 1944 at Wright Field, Ohio, and the following year at Eglin Field, Florida.
This set of items constitute the NASA Space Flight Medal awarded to Dr. Sally K. Ride after her first space flight aboard STS-7 in 1983. The medal is bestowed upon all space flight crew members after the completion of a mission.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program.

Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the medals and accompanying items to the Museum in 2013.
The 1909 Wright Military Flyer is the world's first military airplane. In 1908, the U.S. Army Signal Corps sought competitive bids for a two-seat observation aircraft. Winning designs had to meet a number of specified performance standards. Flight trials with the Wrights' entry began at Fort Myer, Virginia, on September 3, 1908. After several days of successful flights, tragedy occurred on September 17, when Orville Wright crashed with Lt. Thomas E. Selfridge, the Army's observer, as his passenger. Orville survived with severe injuries, but Selfridge was killed, becoming the first fatality in a powered airplane.
On June 3, 1909, the Wrights returned to Fort Myer with a new airplane to complete the trials begun in 1908. Satisfying all requirements, the Army purchased the airplane for $30,000, and conducted flight training with it at nearby College Park, Maryland, and at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio, Texas, in 1910. It was given to the Smithsonian in 1911.
In 1923, the Packard Motor Car Company began development of a new series of 12-cylinder aircraft engines that would more fully meet the requirements of the Army and Navy. In these new designs, a great step forward was made in decreasing the weight per horsepower. The first engine employing the new construction, the 268 kW (360 hp) Packard 1300, was built under a Navy contract.
While this engine was under development, Packard obtained an Army contract for a refined and enlarged version known as the 1500. This was superseded by the 2A-1500, built in upright direct drive and geared configurations and inverted direct drive configurations. The inverted engine could be mounted with its propeller shaft on top so that the propeller had maximum ground clearance, and also improved pilot visibility.
Among aircraft powered by this engine were the Curtiss R3C-3 racer, the two-engine Huff-Daland XB-1 bomber, Boeing FB-5 pursuit aircraft, and Navy PN-10 seaplane.
This engine, built by the Glenn H. Curtiss Manufacturing Company of Hammondsport, New York, about 1907 is believed to be a Model C-4 or D-4 engine. The Model C-4 was designed specifically as a power plant for a U.S. military dirigible. It was built as a light aeronautical engine and was fitted with mechanical valves and auxiliary ports. A propeller was connected directly to its drive shaft.
The Model D-4 was identical with the Model C-4 excepting that it was water cooled. The D-4 was designed as a lightweight engine recommended by Curtiss for marine applications where the added weight of about 34 kg (75 lb) for the water-cooling system was not objectionable. Both engine models were rated at 19 kW (25 shp). This motor, which has both air- (cylinder heads) and water-cooled (cylinder barrels), is believed to have powered a 1910 aircraft owned by Ralph M. Kinderman.
The T700 engine evolved directly from Army experience in the Vietnam War's difficult operating conditions that created helicopter engine maintenance problems. GE won the 1971 power plant competition for the proposed Utility Tactical Transport System (UTTAS) helicopter, with specifications for a high performance, low fuel consumption, reduced maintenance, and combat damage resistant engine. This is one of the experimental engines used in the UTTAS rotorcraft competition in 1974.
Modular construction allowed major engine assemblies to be replaced in the field within minutes. New compressor and intake design reduced maintenance and foreign object damage. A self-contained oil system and suction fuel system made the engine less vulnerable to combat damage.
Among military T700 powered helicopters were the Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk and SH-60 Seahawk, McDonnell Douglas AH-64 Apache, and Bell AH-1W SuperCobra. Commercial applications included the Bell 214ST and Sikorsky S-70C. The CT7 turboprop version powered such commuter aircraft as the Saab 340 and CASA/IPTN CN-235.
The Thomas brothers of Upstate New York began experimenting and flying Curtiss-type aircraft in 1908, and developed their own aircraft in the 1909-10 period. Thomas Brothers aircraft were supplied to the Allied nations during World War I. Airplane engines were built by the Thomas Aeromotor Company, which was later reorganized and became known as the Thomas-Morse Aircraft Corporation of Ithaca, New York. The company's first engine, a 4-cylinder vertical water-cooled design rated at 89.5 kW (120 shp), was produced in 1912. After that, the company confined its efforts entirely to 8-cylinder water-cooled V-types.
The Thomas-Morse Model 8 engine was fitted with reduction gears to reduce propeller speed to 1,200 rpm. It was the first aircraft engine to be equipped with a self-starter. It powered aircraft such as the Thomas D-5 and L.W.F.
This is the Sonic Wind 1 rocket sled, which was powered by nine solid fuel rockets with 40,000 pounds total thrust for five seconds. Air Force Lt. Col. John Stapp first rode the sled on March 19, 1954, at Holloman Air Force Base, New Mexico, and reached a speed of 613 feet per second. During acceleration, he was subjected to a force of 22 times that of gravity (22 g's). He made his second run on the sled on August 20, 1954 attaining a speed of 735 feet per second.
On December 10, 1954, he made his last and most notable ride on the sled reaching a speed of 632 miles per hour. Stapp underwent a force of 40 g's, the highest g force any human had endured to that time. The sled rides helped determine the effects of extreme acceleration on the human body, data that was very useful in aerospace medicine.
The sled was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1966 by the U.S. Air Force.
This is the proof test article of the Viking Mars Lander. For exploration of Mars, Viking represented the culmination of a series of exploratory missions that had begun in 1964 with Mariner 4 and continued with Mariner 6 and Mariner 7 flybys in 1969 and a Mariner 9 orbital mission in 1971 and 1972. The Viking mission used two identical spacecraft, each consisting of a lander and an orbiter. Launched on August 20, 1975 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Viking 1 spent nearly a year cruising to Mars, placed an orbiter in operation around the planet, and landed on July, 20 1976 on the Chryse Planitia (Golden Plains). Viking 2 was launched on September 9, 1975 and landed on September 3, 1976. The Viking project's primary mission ended on November 15, 1976, 11 days before Mars's superior conjunction (its passage behind the sun), although the Viking spacecraft continued to operate for six years after first reaching Mars. The last transmission from the planet reached Earth on November 11, 1982.
While Viking 1 and 2 were on Mars, this third vehicle was used on Earth to simulate their behavior and to test their responses to radio commands. Earlier, it had been used to demonstrate that the landers could survive the stresses they would encounter during the mission.
NASA transferred this artifact to the Museum in 1979.
This TELEX E-6B dead reckoning computer belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. It is a circular slide rule used in aviation for calculating factors such as fuel burn, wind correction, ground speed, and estimated time of arrival. As a mission specialist astronaut, Ride was not responsible for piloting the space shuttle, but as part of her training she was expected to spend fifteen hours a month aloft in the backseat of a T-38 jet. These flights allowed Ride to practice navigation and communication procedures while also being conditioned for high-performance flight. Ride, whose previous flying experience was limited to commercial airliners, so enjoyed these flights that she took private lessons and earned her pilot license
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 in the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger accident in 1986 and the Columbia Accident Investigation Board in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987, titled “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space” but known popularly as the "Ride Report."
After she left NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego, where she also served as the director of the California Space Institute. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she founded to promote science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the computer to the Museum in 2013.
The Hall-Scott Motor Car Company, with general offices in San Francisco and factories at Berkeley, California, began specializing in the construction of airplane engines in 1911. The water-cooled 30 kW (40 hp) Type A-1 was the first aircraft engine produced by the company. This was followed the 45 kW (60 hp) Model A-2 and the 60 kW (80 hp) Model A-3, both water-cooled V-8 engines.
The Hall-Scott Model A-7-A primarily powered the World War I Standard Aero Corporation Standard J aircraft. The Standard J and its Hall-Scott A-7-A engine along with the Curtiss JN-4D with its OX-5 engine were the two primary trainer aircraft and engines built in the U.S. during World War I. Despite vibration common to four-cylinder engines at the time, the A-7-A was otherwise regarded by experts as a rugged and dependable motor. The A-7-A also powered other Standard, Aero Marine, and Dayton-Wright aircraft.
This M2-F3 lifting body was the first of the heavyweight, wingless lifting body research craft of the 1960s. The lifting body programs tested the concept of achieving aerodynamic lift from just the shape of wingless craft, a concept used in designing the Space Shuttle. This F3 is the F2 re-built after a landing accident seriously damaged the M2-F2. The rocket-powered M2 was launched from beneath a B-52 mother craft at an altitude of 45,000 ft. and would glide to a landing. NASA transferred the M2-F3 to the Museum for display in 1975.
Mitsubishi was the first and largest series producer of Japanese engines during World War II, with a 1937 Pratt & Whitney arrangement possibly contributing to this success. This 18-cylinder, two-row, air cooled aircraft engine incorporated two-speed reduction gearing, a cooling fan, and twin transverse superchargers to achieve two stage supercharging.
Four of these engines were to power the Kawasaki Ki-91 Army Experimental Long-range Bomber, which was to be larger than the Boeing B-29 and have a 4,474 km (2,796 miles) radius of action. The design of this bomber began in May 1943, and a prototype was under construction at the end of 1944, but planned production was suspended in February 1945 when tooling was destroyed during a B-29 raid before the prototype was completed. Between 1940 and 1945, a total of 2,813 Mitsubishi Ha 42 series (all models) were built.
During the Apollo 11 mission, Magazine N was used in the command module from just after launch until the spacecraft entered lunar orbit. The color images on this magazine include images of Earth, the crew as it travelled to the Moon and prepared the lunar module, as well as the lunar surface. Hasselblad cameras and magazines, selected for their reliability and high quality, were used on all lunar missions. The magazines were easily switched out at any time, allowing crew members change between color and black and white film at a moments notice.
NASA transferred this film magazine to the Museum in 1970.
This is a duplicate of a hand-wrought survival knife made by the Randall Knives Co., a maker of speciality knives of all types. One was carried as equipment on Alan Shepard's "Freedom 7" suborbital Mercury mission on May 5, 1961. On this flight, Shepard became the first American, and second human (after Yuri Gagarin), in space. The original survival knife was lost when the hatch was jettisoned after landing in the Atlantic Ocean.
W.D. Randall, Jr., gave this knife to the Smithsonian.
In early 1921, the Navy contracted with the Packard Motor Car Company, to develop the new Model 1A-1551 engine for its proposed ZR-1 airship, later named Shenandoah.
The engine carried with it an instrument and control panel for the operator. A hand crank, with automatic engagement and disengagement and geared 10 to 1, was provided for starting. Due to the necessity of directing the exhaust away from the ship for side-by-side installations, the engines were designed so that they could be easily changed to run in either direction.
Installed in "cars" attached to the airship, five Model 1A-1551 engines powered the Shenandoah, which made its first flight in October 1923. Mechanics controlled and serviced the engines in flight from these cars. In October 1924, the Shenandoah became the first airship to make a U.S. transcontinental trip. But, in September 1925, the Shenandoah broke up in a severe thunderstorm near Caldwell, Ohio, and crashed.
This is the Skylab 4 Command Module, which served as the crew cabin for going to and from Skylab, the first U.S. space station. Skylab 4, the third and last of the Skylab missions, was launched on November 16, 1973 with Command and Service Modules CSM-118. The three-person crew, Gerald P. Carr, William R. Pogue, and Edward G. Gibson, spent 84 days on orbit, landing on February 8, 1974. The mission included the observation of the comet Kohoutek, among numerous experiments. The crew completed 1,214 Earth orbits and four extra-vehicular activities totaling 22 hours, 13 minutes.
CSM-118 was transferred from NASA to the Smithsonian in 1975.
The Cessna 150 and 152 became the most popular civilian training aircraft after World War II, as well as economical recreational vehicles for weekend pilots. The series still serves as the principal two-seat, general aviation trainer in the United States. The A152 Aerobat, with greater structural strength to withstand up to +6g and -3g forces, appeals to those looking for a little more basic aerobatic and spin capability.
William K. Kershner bought this A152 in 1984 for his ACE Aerobatic School in Sewanee, Tennessee. A pilot for 61 years, Kershner flew more than 11,000 hours in military and civilian aircraft and performed over 7,000 spins for instruction and research purposes. He wrote five flying manuals, laced with technical wisdom and his trademark wit, that thousands of pilots worldwide have relied upon. In this airplane, 435 students completed his spin training course.
Under the auspices of the U.S. Army Air Service, the Fokker T-2 made the first nonstop U.S. transcontinental flight in 1923. Two failed attempts at a west-to-east crossing were followed by a successful east-to-west flight when Air Service Lieutenants Oakley Kelly and John Macready took off from Long Island, New York, on May 2 and landed at Rockwell Field, San Diego, California, on May 3, slightly more than 26 hours and 50 minutes later.
The airplane was the fourth in a series of transport designs by famed Dutch manufacturer Anthony Fokker and his chief designer, Rheinhold Platz. Manufactured as a Fokker F-IV, the aircraft was purchased by the U.S. Army Air Service in June 1922 and re-designated the Air Service Transport 2, or T-2. Required modifications for the transcontinental flight, such as increasing the fuel capacity, making structural reinforcements, and adding a second set of controls, were carried out at McCook Field, Dayton, Ohio.
Many people consider the P-51 Mustang the best fighter of World War II. Its combination of speed, range, maneuverability, and firepower gave it great versatility. Its use in all major theaters of the war included long-range high-altitude escort, strafing, and photo reconnaissance.
Originally developed by North American for the British, the Mustang was later ordered in large quantities by the U.S. Army Air Forces. This P-51 is displayed in the markings of the 351st Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group,Eighth Air Force.
This controllable-pitch propeller, one of the first produced by Hamilton Standard, represented a major advance in aircraft technology in the early 1930s. It allowed a pilot to adjust the propeller blade's pitch to provide the best performance at different air speeds (similar to changing gears in a car or on a bicycle). On takeoff the pilot chose a lower pitch to make the blade spin faster and provide maximum power. In flight the pilot switched to a higher pitch to make the blade spin slower and conserve fuel.
This particular propeller was from a Lockheed Vega airplane owned by the Crosley Radio Corporation and flown by Ruth Nichols. Flying in that airplane in 1931-32, Nichols became the only woman to hold simultaneously the women's international speed, altitude, and distance records for flight. She set the distance record in October 1931 when she flew 1,977 miles between Oakland, California and Louisville, Kentucky. Nichols' records proved the effectiveness of the new controllable-pitch propeller.
This is the backup primary mirror for the Hubble Space Telescope manufactured by the Eastman Kodak Company. The blank for this mirror was fabricated by the Corning Glass Works using their high silicon Ultra Low Expansion Glass (ULE 7971). It consists of two 1-inch glass disks fused to the faces of a thin square eggcrate-like support structure. This support structure creates a mirror that weighs about one-fifth that of a solid piece of the same size but retains required rigidity and stability characteristics. The blank mirror was sent to the Kodak Apparatus Division located in Rochester, NY, when they won a NASA contract to create the back-up optical mirror. Kodak ground the mirror surface into the proper concave shape and then polished it to successively finer tolerances using computer-assisted testing routines. The finished mirror was tested and verified by Kodak to meet the strict optical tolerances prescribed by NASA. It was left un-aluminized mirror and delivered to the Perkin-Elmer Corporation in Danbury Connecticut, the prime contractor for the flight mirror, and was stored there until the end of 2000, at which time NASA determined that its value as a display object was greater than its potential value as a telescope mirror. It was then transferred from NASA to NASM by Raytheon, who absorbed Perkin-Elmer.
Herman A. Ecker learned to fly probably in 1911, making the first flight in his hometown of Syracuse, New York, that same year. After honing his skills as a pilot and an airplane builder with several other aircraft (possibly as many as four), he built the flying boat in the NASM collection probably in 1912 or early 1913. Ecker patterned his airplane closely after the highly successful Curtiss Model E and F flying boats. By 1912, Ecker was taking passengers aloft and doing exhibitions at fairs and other public gatherings. Some of this exhibition flying was certainly done with the aircraft in the NASM collection, but exactly when and where is unknown. Despite the similarity in general appearance with the commercially produced Curtiss flying boat, the Ecker airplane bears the hallmarks of a lone builder, long on enthusiasm and ingenuity, but short on resources and access to the latest technology.
The Daimler-Benz company's virtual monopoly on the production of aircraft engines in Germany stifled research and development of other engines. As a result, when the Allies introduced a new generation of high-performance engines in 1916, Germany found itself without a suitable replacement for its now-obsolete standard aircraft power plant, the 119 kw (160-shp) Daimler-Benz Mercedes.
Believing that he had a solution to the crisis, Daimler-Benz designer Max Fritz proposed a new engine that used the same technology as the older Mercedes. But his ideas met with resistance, so Fritz left and joined Bayerische Motoren Werke (BMW). There he designed an engine that retained the 6-cylinder in-line configuration of the earlier Daimler-Benz engines, but was superior in many respects.
The BMW Model IIIa had unusually low fuel consumption and very good performance at high altitudes. This was the result of a choked down carburetor setting and a high compression ratio. It powered such aircraft as the Fokker D VII.
The Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a CCD camera attached to a powerful telescope with a 700mm focal length. It can take black and white images of the Moon with a resolution of less than a meter.
This flight spare instrument is identical to the flown instrument built by Malin Space Science Systems. NASA transferred the camera to the Museum in 2016.
Stardust was the first U.S. space mission dedicated solely to returning extraterrestrial material from beyond the Moon. It collected samples from Comet Wild 2 and interstellar dust. Launched in 1999, it returned to Earth seven years later, parachuting to a landing in the Utah desert in 2006.
The Stardust return system has six major components: a heat shield, back shell, sample canister, sample collector grids, parachute system, and avionics. The canister containing the samples was sealed in an exterior shell that protected them from the heat of reentering Earth's atmosphere. The material Stardust returned may date from the formation of the solar system. Scientific studies of the samples are altering our understanding of the universe. One major discovery is that ice-rich comets, the coldest and most distant bodies in the solar system, also contain fragments of materials.
NASA transferred Stardust to the Museum in 2008.
This model depicts the ambitious space station Freedom concept that was promoted in the mid-to-late 1980s. Named by President Ronald Reagan as a beacon of American leadership in space, Freedom was meant to be a versatile facility for business and research in earth orbit. This concept proved to be too costly to gain lasting political support, and the project was reconfigured under President Bill Clinton to become the International Space Station. McDonnell Douglas, one of the bidders for the space station contract, gave this model to the Museum in 1988.
The 1912 Gage biplane in the NASM collection is referred to as the Fowler-Gage, in recognition of its owner and pilot, Robert G. Fowler. Beginning in October 1912, Fowler made numerous exhibition and passenger flights in California. He made his most famous flight in the airplane in 1913, flying ocean-to-ocean across Panama. With the Gage now on floats, Fowler started his Isthmus of Panama crossing with a takeoff from the Pacific side at 9:45 a.m. on April 27. It was an extraordinarily dangerous flight, with no open areas available for emergency landings. Nevertheless, he completed the 83 km (52 mi) flight in one hour and 45 minutes, landing with his passenger/cameraman, R.E. Duhem, at Cristobal at 11:30 a.m.
Fowler continued to perform further exhibition and passenger-carrying flights, as well as flying linemen on inspection trips over the transmission lines between Sacramento and Oraville, California, for the Great Western Power Company. He retired the airplane in 1915.
In the spring of 1917, Britain's most famous World War I fighter, the Sopwith Camel, made its debut. Shortly after deliveries to front-line squadrons of the Camel began, Sopwith designed a new single-seat fighter called the Snipe. The new airplane was simply intended to be a derivation of the Camel, with improved visibility for the pilot, and gentler handling qualities, more reminiscent of the earlier Sopwith Pup. After nearly a year in development, the new fighter went into production in spring 1918, and the first examples arrived in squadron service on August 30 of that year.
The Snipe was well-liked by those who flew it, but many Camel pilots, having mastered the tricky habits of their previous mount, were reluctant to relinquish the Camel's superior combat maneuverability for the Snipe's more stable flight characteristics. Snipes generally were used for escort work, but the airplane could be equipped with four 9 kg (20 lb) Cooper bombs beneath the fuselage.
Scottish immigrant, Don Mitchell, designed the successful series of ultralight, all-wing airplanes called the B-10 and the U-2 Superwing. He began work on the B-10 in 1975 and the aircraft first flew in 1976. This simple inexpensive, fun flyer became so popular that Mitchell decided to design a new version that he designated the U-2. He made many improvements and first flew the new version in 1979.
To convert the basic B-10 airframe into a U-2, Mitchell modified the wing and added a completely enclosed cockpit, but he gave builders the option to install fixed or retractable landing gear. The pilot could operate the wingtip rudders either independently to provide yaw control or simultaneously for aerodynamic braking. Stabilators suspended at the trailing edge of each outboard wing panel provided pitch and roll control. The U-2 had nose wheel steering and braking. A small, two-cycle pusher engine propelled this single-seat, single-engine, flying wing. The factory had sold more than 1,500 Superwing kits by the mid-1980s, largely because Mitchell initially priced the basic kits to sell at $2,795, less power and paint. He estimated that the builder with average skills could complete a Superwing airframe in 250 hours, and spend another 100 hours or so installing the engine and painting the ultralight.
Pilots could either fly the U-2 as a powered aircraft or switch off the engine and soar as a sailplane. Advertised lift-to-drag ratio was 25:1. A pilot flying a U-2 set the World Record Altitude for Class C1 (single-engine land aircraft not exceeding 297 kg/661 lb gross weight) in 1984 when he flew to 7,886 m (25,940 ft). Pilots generally favored the ultralight's flying and maintenance qualities but some reported difficulty handling the airplane in all but light winds.
Burt Rutan invigorated the homebuilt aircraft movement when he began selling the plans to build his VariEze ('very easy') during summer 1976. Compared to nearly all other homebuilt designs, the VariEze was easier to build, yet it performed better, and cost much less, than the airplanes produced by Cessna, Beechcraft, or Piper. Propelled by a 100-horsepower engine, a VariEze, built to Rutan's specifications, could carry two adults for about 1,127 km (700 miles) at approximately 290 kph (180 mph). Loaded light without a passenger and only an hour of fuel on board, most VariEzes could climb at 608 m (2,000 ft) per minute and reach altitudes near 7,600 m (25,000 ft).
The VariEze had other important attributes besides performance that appealed to many individuals who wanted to build their own airplanes. The VariEze looked exotic and unusual but aside from the canard configuration, and the composite foam/fiberglass structure, the airplane was mechanically simple and orthodox. A builder with average mechanical skills could construct the aircraft quickly and inexpensively, and the airplane was economical to fly and maintain. Rutan sold more than 3,000 plan sets by the end of 1979 and by 1980, two hundred VariEzes were flying. In 1985, following a protracted lawsuit brought by the relatives of a passenger killed in the crash of a Long-EZ (another Rutan canard design), Rutan decided to stop selling plans for all Rutan airplanes.
Dr. Erich Bachem's Ba 349 Natter (Viper) was the world's first, manned, vertical-take-off interceptor. The aircraft was an imaginative solution to a desperate problem but World War II ended before the weapon saw combat. Dr. Werner von Baun first proposed the concept in 1939 but the Air Ministry (RLM) rejected it as "unnecessary and unworkable." Bachem, an engineer with the Fieseler works, thought the idea had merit. He tried but failed to generate interest in several different proposals for a rocket interceptor.
During spring 1944, the Allied bombing offensive began taking a serious toll on the German war machine. None of the conventional methods employed by the Luftwaffe to intercept the bombers seemed to work so the service began to explore unconventional means. The RLM Technical Office issued requirements for an inexpensive fighter made of non-essential materials that could defend important targets. Messerschmitt, Junkers, Heinkel, and Erich Bachem submitted proposals but RLM officials remained unenthusiastic about Bachem's design. They chose a more conventional offering from Heinkel but Bachem refused to give up. He sought the support of Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS (Nazi Party security forces). Himmler liked Bachem's proposal and signed an order to build 150 Natters using SS funds. It was now possible that the SS might develop an aircraft beyond the RLM's control so they placed their own order for 50 Natters and announced the official designation, Bachem Ba 349.
Bachem's design was simple and easy to build. Semi-skilled labor could construct one in about 1000 man-hours. The wings were plain rectangular wooden slabs without ailerons, flaps, or other control devices. The cruciform tail consisted of four fins and control surfaces. Deflecting these surfaces in various combinations controlled pitch, yaw, and roll, once the Ba 349 had reached sufficient speed to generate adequate airflow. Aerodynamic control was augmented by guide vanes connected to the four control surfaces. Bachem positioned each vane within the exhaust plume of the main engine, a Walter 109-509A rocket motor. This is the same basic engine used in the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet (also preserved in the NASM collection). Two liquid fuels combined inside the motor to generate thrust. When T-Stoff (a highly caustic solution of hydrogen peroxide and a stabilizing chemical) mixed with C-Stoff (a hydrazine hydrate/methanol/water mixture), combustion was spontaneous so extreme care was required to handle both chemicals. The Walter motor generated about 1,700 kg (3,740 lb) of thrust but a loaded Ba 349A weighed more than 1,818 kg (4,000 lb) so liftoff required more power.
Bachem got the extra thrust from four Schmidding 109-533 solid-fuel rocket motors that he bolted to the aft fuselage, two per side. Each motor produced 500 kg (1,100 lb) of thrust. At liftoff, all five motors ignited, generating about 3,700 kg (8,140 lb) of thrust. The resulting 1.6 to 1 thrust-to-weight ratio produced acceptable climb performance.
Natter operations were relatively simple and the following account describes a hypothetical mission. A 24 m (79 ft) tower guided the rocket plane during liftoff. The wingtips and lower fin fit inside guide rails to stabilize the aircraft until it cleared the tower. The flight controls remained locked in neutral position until the solid boosters burned out about 10 seconds into the flight. At burnout, explosive bolts blasted away the solids, the flight controls unlocked, and the Natter's 3-axis Patin autopilot began receiving steering commands from the ground via radio. The airplane continued climbing but the pilot could intercede at any time and take full control. Bachem calculated maximum climb rate at 11,563 m (37, 400 ft) meters per minute but flight tests did not confirm this figure.
American daylight bomber formations often approached a target at an altitude of 6,250 m (20,000 ft) to 9,375 m (30,000 ft). After the Natter had climbed even with the formation, the pilot took control, steering his Natter in close. At a range of about 1.6-3.2 kilometers (1-2 miles) from the formation, the Natter pilot jettisoned the nose cone and shotgun style, salvoed all 24 Henschel Hs 217 Föhn unguided rockets.
Rocket fuel would be nearly exhausted by now, so the pilot began to descend. At about 1,400 m (4500 ft), the pilot released his seat harness and fired a ring of explosive bolts to blow off the entire nose section. A parachute simultaneously deployed from the rear fuselage and the sudden deceleration literally threw the pilot from his seat. The pilot activated his own parachute after waiting a safe interval to clear the bits of falling Natter. Ground crews recovered the Walter motor to use again but the airframe was now scrap.
Bachem set up a factory to design and build his dream at Waldsee in the Black Forest. By November 1944, the first Natter was ready for tests configured as a motorless glider. A Heinkel He 111 bomber carried one to 18,000 ft and released it. The pilot found the aircraft easy to control. At 1000 m (3,200 ft), he fired the explosive bolts and the escape sequence worked as designed. A powered vertical launch failed on December 18 because of faulty ground equipment design. On December 22, the aircraft made its first successful launch with the solid fuel boosters only because the Walter motor was not ready. Ten more successful launches followed during the next several months. Early in 1945, the Walter engine arrived and the Natter launched successfully with a complete propulsion system on February 25, 1945, carrying a dummy pilot. The launch proved that the complete flight profile was workable. All went according to plan, including recovery of the pilot dummy and Walter rocket motor.
Now a man had to fly and the first test came on February 28. Oberleutnant Lothar Siebert climbed into a Ba 349A, strapped in, and rocketed off the launch tower. At about 500 m (1600 ft), the Natter shed its canopy and headrest and the aircraft veered off and flew into the ground, killing Siebert. No cause was determined but the ground crew may have failed to lock the canopy and it could have struck the pilot. Despite the tragedy, more pilots volunteered to fly and the Bachem team launched three flights in March.
With the end near, the Germans erected a battery of ten Natters at Kircheim near Stuttgart. Pilots stood alert day after day but no U. S. bombers flew into range. The U. S. Seventh Army overran the site but not before the Germans blew up all ten Natters and their launchers.
It is interesting to speculate about the Natter's potential effectiveness. Realistic flight training was next to impossible using an aircraft that destroyed itself after every flight. However, given the short duration of a typical interception (about 5-10 minutes), and positive ground control for much of the flight, the German could have eased training with a simple ground simulator. Once the German's erected a Natter site, U. S. Army Air Forces strike planners could easily route the bombers out of harm's way. Accuracy of the unguided rocket salvo is also questionable and it was a one-shot opportunity. It is safe to assume that the Bachem Ba 349A Natter was a bad idea from the start and as a bomber interceptor, it was a total failure.
Only two Bachem Natters are known to exist. The Deutsches Museum, Munich, Germany, displays a Ba 349A restored in the colors and markings of one of the unmanned test aircraft. The NASM has the other Natter. U. S. forces captured this artifact at war's end and shipped it to Freeman Field, Indiana, for analysis. The captured equipment number T2-1 was assigned to the Natter and the U. S. Air Force transferred it to the National Air Museum (now NASM) on May 1, 1949.
In 1911, Glenn Curtiss was awarded the prestigious Collier Trophy for the development of the hydroaeroplane, a land airplane mounted on floats. In 1913, Curtiss developed the first practical and highly successful flying boat, the Model E, with the entire fuselage being a hull rather than mounting the aircraft on floats. The later Model F perfected the flying boat design with the incorporation of a V hull, supplanting the less efficient flat-bottomed hull of the Model E.
Among the Curtiss Model E Flying Boats produced in 1913 was one sold to Logan A. "Jack" Vilas of Chicago. Vilas' Model E was powered by a 90-horsepower Curtiss OX engine. With this aircraft, Vilas made the first crossing of Lake Michigan, flying from St. Joseph, Michigan, to Grant Park on Chicago's waterfront in July 1913. Vilas donated the hull of his Model E Flying Boat to the Smithsonian Institution in 1949. Nothing else of the aircraft survives.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
The Autosyn was a system developed by the Eclipse-Pioneer Division of the Bendix Aviation Corporation to eliminate the cumbersome plumbing required for instrumentation in increasingly large aircraft. Instead of having many feet of piping, vulnerable to blockage or leaks, the autosyn system used a transmitter located at the source of the input that converted the mechanical or electro-mechanical impulses from a sensor into electrical signals that were sent to a standardized indicator on the instrument panel. The indicator would have a simple easily mounted face that was appropriate to the input sensed by the transmitter.
Curtiss was one of the most successful early American aircraft engine manufacturers. The first Curtiss engines were air cooled but, to achieve higher power, Curtiss began to develop liquid-cooled engines. Historical evidence suggests that this Model L artifact was one of two higher-performance engines built by Curtiss for his experimental monoplane that was shown, but not flown, at the 1910 Gordon Bennett Race held at Belmont Park, N.Y. Both engines were later assigned to Eugene Ely, a pilot for Curtiss, who used them in exhibition and demonstration flights. It is likely that one of those engines powered the aircraft which crashed in 1912 at Macon, Georgia, killing Ely.
Continued evolution of the Curtiss V-8 engine led to the OX-5, of which more than 10,000 were produced by the end of World War I in 1918. The U.S. government sold thousands of these to the public as surplus at a fraction of their original cost.
This is the first foreign-made engine chosen as the basic power plant for a major U.S.-built airliner, the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar, receiving its certification from the Federal Aviation Administration in 1973 for use on that three engine aircraft. In addition, it powered some models of the Boeing 747 transport.
The RB211 differed from other engines in its class in having three instead of two shafts. Each shaft has a compressor on its forward end and a turbine on its aft end. This design permitted each compressor to run nearer its optimum speed and efficiency and reduced the number of blades and other parts required in the engine. The static thrust varied from 160 KN (36,000 pounds) to 245 KN (55,000 pounds).
This RB211-22 engine powered the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar. It has been cutaway to show the relationship of the internal parts.
This is a 1/5 scale model of the Surveyor spacecraft, which was used by NASA and Hughes Aircraft Company engineering teams for demonstration and technical discussions during the soft-landing lunar program. This miniature spacecraft was built by Hughes model makers working from original plans of the flight spacecraft. It closely represents the Surveyor III spacecraft that was later examined by the Apollo 12 astronauts. Five of the seven spacecraft built by Hughes for NASA successfully landed on the moon during the period from June 1966 to January 1968, paving the way for a manned landing on the Moon. Object is currently on display in the Exploring the Planets gallery, NASM 207.
This cockpit instrument provided information on the pressure in the fuel and oxidizer tanks of one of the propulsion and attitude control systems of the Gemini spacecraft. Astronauts flew ten Gemini missions in 1965-66, paving the way for the Apollo missions to the Moon. The key objectives of Gemini were gathering experience with rendezvous and docking, long-duration spaceflight, and extravehicular activity.
NASA transferred this instrument to the Smithsonian in 1972.
This communications carrier was used by astronaut Neil Armstrong during the Apollo 11 mission in July 1969. Communications carriers were worn during launch and the mission, and were affectionately known as the "Snoopy Cap" from its resemblance to a famous cartoon character of the era.
It was constructed of an elastic center portion with Teflon fabric sides containing the communications equipment and mouthpiece. It fastened beneath the chin and was worn during the launch sequence, while in the lunar module, and on the lunar surface.
NASA transferred this object to the Musuem in 1979.
The YH-19 was the first practical single-rotor utility helicopter. The first in Sikorsky's successful S-55 series, it solved the center-of-gravity problems of earlier models by shifting the engine to the front and the passenger compartment to beneath the rotor hub. Other innovations included offset-flapping hinges and hydraulically boosted irreversible controls. Designed for the Air Force for arctic rescue, the S-55 served all U.S. military branches throughout the 1950s, especially during the Korean War and in most major military conflicts of the early Cold War. Civilian versions pioneered helicopter airline service in the United States and abroad.
This is the first S-55. From its first test flight in 1949, it served mainly at the Sikorsky factory demonstrating improvements to the series and generating flight data. Fred Clark of Orlando Helicopter Airways restored it in 1966 for commercial use. Thirty years later he returned it to its original military configuration.
Nakajima provided Japan with its first large radials by building licensed Bristols beginning in the late 1920s, and Gnome-Rhone engines beginning in 1936. Nakajima built three 14-cylinder radial engines. The pre-World War II Mamoru possibly shares characteristics with the Pratt & Whitney R-2000. It was the most powerful 14-cylinder engine ever built, with versions at 1,790 kW (2,400 hp) and one of the largest at 44.49 L (2,715 cu. in.).
This engine is of the type that powered the World War II Japanese Nakajima B6N Navy Carrier Attack Bomber Tenzan Type 11 (Allied Code Name Jill). Between 1941 and 1944, 200 engines of all Mamoru series were manufactured, but these were generally not considered successful. After 1945, the company became Fuji, building airframes only.
In 1945, William H. Bowlus and Ted Nelson formed the Nelson Aircraft Corporation to build a two-seat, motor glider version of the popular Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross. The designers nicknamed this design the Bumblebee but they sold the powered glider under the official moniker, Dragonfly. The men retained the basic Baby Albatross design but significantly widened the cockpit and added side-by-side seating and flight controls for each occupant. Other improvements included tricycle landing gear and a steerable nose landing gear, additional vertical fins mounted on the ends of the horizontal stabilizer, and a hinged canopy. A handle to pull-start the engine was also available inside the cockpit. The aft section of the fuselage pod on the Baby Albatross was an ideal place to install a pusher engine and propeller. Bowlus and Nelson first selected a Ryder four-cylinder, two-cycle power plant but this engine only managed to produce about 16 horsepower. This was not enough power for flight so Nelson decided to build a suitable engine from scratch. His new motor generated 25 horsepower, barely enough to takeoff and slowly climb.
This combination of power plant and propeller allowed the Dragonfly to climb 235 feet per minute at sea level. The extra weight of the engine, plus the drag from the widened fuselage, gave the Dragonfly a mediocre lift-to-drag ratio. The self-launch capability cost too much performance to appeal to most prospective motorglider owners and Bowlus and Nelson only sold seven Dragonflys. Nelson attempted to design another self-launching glider in 1949 but this time, he teamed with Harry Perl. Don Mitchell also helped on the new airplane. Nelson and Perl called this new design the Hummingbird (see NASM collection). Nelson mounted a more powerful Nelson engine on a retractable pylon behind a two-seat, tandem cockpit. This arrangement improved the soaring performance but the aircraft cost much more than a conventional, two-seat glider and Nelson and Perl built only six Hummingbirds.

This is a CRAY-1, an early example of a class of computers called "supercomputers." It was built by Cray Research, Inc. of Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin, and installed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. Unlike most computers, it was hand-wired, and its circuits were arranged in a three-quarters circle. Both helped increase the speeds at which signals travel from one part of the computer to another. Hefty power supplies are located below each of the circuit bays, and the padding on them suggests a piece of lounge furniture.
At NCAR, the machine was used between 1977 and 1983, where it performed complex calculations involving the numerical modeling of weather phenomena. As the speeds of ordinary workstations increased over the years, it became obsolete and was donated to the Smithsonian.
Flying this specially modified Lockheed 5C Vega, famed aviator Wiley Post set many records and pioneered several aviation technologies. In 1931 Post and navigator Harold Gatty flew it around the world in eight days, and in 1933 Post became the first to fly around the world solo, taking only seven days. In 1935, while wearing the world's first pressure suit, which he helped design, Post flew the Vega into the stratosphere, reaching 547 kilometers (340 miles) per hour while cruising in the jet stream. The Winnie Mae was named for the daughter of F. C. Hall, the original owner and a close friend of Post.
Designed by John K. "Jack" Northrop, the Lockheed Vega first flew in 1927. It was the first aircraft with the NACA cowl, which streamlined the airflow around and through the engine. This decreased drag and increased power plant cooling.
This NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) temporary ID badge belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. It was issued to her in October 1977 when she arrived there for a week of medical tests and interviews for the astronaut selection program. Ride, then a Ph.D. candidate in physics at Stanford University, had applied to the program in January along with nearly 8,000 other people. The invitation to JSC meant that she was a finalist for the program. Three months later, in January 1978, NASA announced that she and five other women and 29 men had been chosen to form the first class of astronauts for the space shuttle era. This historic astronaut class also was the first to include women, African Americans, and an American of Asian descent. Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the badge to the Museum in 2013.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger tragedy in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic plan in 1987, titled “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” known popularly as the "Ride Report." After she left NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego, where she also served as director of the California Space Institute. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she founded to promote science education.
This Shapiro Award was presented to Dr. Sally K. Ride in October 2004. The award honors Joseph Shapiro, and is presented annually to individuals who have demonstrated the ability to create positive and lasting change in their communities. Ride was recognized for her achievements as an astronaut as well as for the creation of Sally Ride Science, an organization that promotes science education. The award was presented during The Billie Jean King and Friends Event, a fundraiser held by the California State University at Los Angeles (CSULA) to enhance its student-athlete program.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003.

This object is a flight spare of the Pioneer IV spacecraft, which was launched March 3, 1959, on a Juno II launch vehicle. The principal objectives of Pioneer IV were to measure radiation in space, test a photo-electric sensor in the vicinity of the Moon, sample the Moon's radiation, and test long-range tracking. On March 4, 1959, it came within 37,300 miles of the Moon, which was somewhat short of the original goal of 20,000 miles. It was tracked for 82 hours to a distance of 407,000 miles. Currently, Pioneer IV is in solar orbit.
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory donated this object to the Museum in 1961.
Improved from the earlier PT-16, the PT-22 was a military trainer aircraft used by the United States Army Air Corps and it successor, the United States Army Air Forces. It was the first low wing monoplane used for primary pilot training and made for a smoother transition to more demanding low wing fighters during World War II. The Army Air Forces accepted 1,023 PT-22s. Ryan also built additional aircraft for the U.S. Navy, and as part of Lend/Lease contracts with China and other Allies.
This Recruit was originally the third of twenty-five built under contract as a float plane trainer for use in the Netherlands East Indies but the sale fell through after the N.E.I. surrendered to Japanese forces in May 1942. It then was used as an AAF trainer until declared surplus late in the war. Since 1944, this Recruit has had nearly two dozen owners who have cared for and preserved the aircraft-some have flown this aircraft in air shows, others just for pleasure.
This flight jacket belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride, who became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Shuttle astronauts wore this type of flight jacket to work and public appearances. The decorations told the individual's story. Here, the leather nametag identifies the mission on which Ride earned her astronaut wings, STS-7. The patch across the chest indicates that she was one of 35 astronauts selected in 1978 as the first group chosen for the space shuttle program. On the right shoulder is the patch for her other mission. The American flag and NASA logo patches appear on all astronaut uniforms. Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the jacket to the Museum in 2013.

Ford 5-AT Tri-Motor
Affectionately known as the “Tin Goose,” the Ford Tri-Motor was the largest civil aircraft in America when it first flew on August 2, 1926. Its all-metal, corrugated aluminum construction and the prestigious Ford name made it immediately popular with passengers and airline operators. Noisy but reliable, the Ford Tri-Motor played a major role in convincing the public that air travel was safe and practical.
The 5-AT, a more powerful version of the earlier 4-AT, had three Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial engines and entered service in 1928. The airplane on display above was restored by American Airlines.

The aircraft that enjoyed what was perhaps the longest and most sucessful career in air racing history was Steve Wittman's Chief Oshkosh, known in the post-World War II era as Buster. From 1931 until its retirement in 1954, this midget racer set records and took numerous trophies in class races and free-for-alls.
Although Wittman was plagued with several problems in this, his first homebuilt racer, he placed high each year in major races in Los Angeles, Cleveland, Miami, and Chicago. In 1937, Chief Oshkosh set a new world's record for its class over a 100-kilometer course at Detroit with a speed of 383.30 kilometers per hour (238.22 miles per hour).
NASA used this Space Shuttle orbiter concept model in wind tunnel tests to learn about the flight characteristics of the vehicle's shape. Although the orbiter would spend most of its time in space, its aerodynamic shape would affect its passage through the atmosphere during launch and descent. This model has wide delta wings for greater cross-range maneuverability during final descent; that is, without engine power, it could glide across a wider swath of land to reach the runway than other wing shapes. However, delta wings meant a heavier orbiter and more surface heating during reentry. NASA transferred a variety of wind tunnel and concept models to the Museum after settling on the final Space Shuttle design.
The Boeing F4B/P-12 series served as the primary fighter of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army Air Corps in the early 1930s, and it remained in service in numerous roles until the early 1940s. It was the last wooden-winged, biplane fighter produced by Boeing and used by the U.S. military. The large quantity of F4B/P-12s built and purchased helped to establish Boeing as an important aircraft manufacturer and to sustain the firm through the economic hardships of the Great Depression. Total production of the F4B/P-12 series reached 586.
The fourth and final version of the design was the F4B-4, 92 of which were built. Twenty-one were assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. The NASM F4B-4 is one of these. It was assigned to Marine Fighting Squadron 10, and served there until July 1933. It was then transferred to VF-9M at Quantico, Virginia, where it flew until 1939.
Frank B. Halford was a talented independent British engine designer of the early and mid-twentieth century who worked for a number of manufacturers including de Havilland, Cirrus and Fiat. In 1928, he contracted with Napier for design of a series of air-cooled engines in a vertical H configuration having twin crankshafts geared together. There were two basic types, the 16-cylinder Rapier and the 24-cylinder Dagger. The Rapier, produced in small numbers, powered the Short Mercury seaplane. By 1935, the Dagger served a large military market, and the British Air Ministry ordered it in quantity. Both the lower powered Dagger I and Dagger II versions powered the Hawker Hart aircraft. The final version, the 712 kW (955 shp) Dagger VIII, powered the Fairey Battle I and Handley Page H.P.52 Hereford I.
Late in his career, with access to the work of Frank Whittle, Halford led the de Havilland Engine Co. where he designed turbine engines.
Beginning around 1922, J.F. Irwin’s Irwin Aircraft Company of Watsonville, California designed and provided blueprints for small, single seat sport aircraft which were supposedly simple enough for enthusiastic amateurs to build. In 1925, it introduced its Meteormotor. In 1926, it was improved by using copper instead of iron for cylinder cooling fins. Although classified as a radial, it was actually two opposed twins at ninety degrees to each other. This engine powered the Irwin M-T-2 and C-C-1 aircraft.

This torch and accompanying plaque are from Dr. Sally K. Ride's participation in the 2002 Olympic Torch Relay which preceded the Winter Games in Salt Lake City. The photograph shows her carrying the torch through San Diego, CA on January 14, 2002. The theme for torchbearers that year was "Inspire"-- torchbearers were nominated on the basis of how they inspired others.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the torch and plaque to the Museum in 2013.
In 1916, Albatros Werke produced the remarkably advanced Albatros D.I. It featured a streamlined semi-monocoque fuselage, with an almost fully-enclosed 160-horsepower in-line Mercedes engine, and the propeller spinner neatly contoured into the nose of the fuselage. A sesquiplane version with narrow-chord lower wings, designated the D-III, was introduced early in 1917, and served with great success, despite the narrow lower wing being susceptible to frequent failure in prolonged dives. The Albatros D.V model was fitted with a more powerful 180-horsepower engine, but was plagued by a rash of upper-wing failures. The wings were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va. Unfortunately, the necessary strengthening increased the weight and negated the performance advantage of the new engine. The D.V and D.Va also continued to experience the same lower wing failure problems in a dive similar to the earlier D.III. A small auxiliary strut was added at the bottom of the outer wing struts to address the issue, but was not entirely successful.
Approximately 4,800 Albatros fighters of all types were built during World War I. They were used extensively by the German Air Service throughout 1917, and remained in action in considerable numbers until the end of the war. Many of the highest-scoring German aces achieved the majority of their victories while flying Albatros fighters.
The CD-12 development history extended over several years, and involved a number of well regarded figures in the aircraft industry. Beginning in 1915, using the design skills of Charles Kirkham, and in competition with Wright which was licensed to build the popular Hispano-Suiza engine in the United States, Curtiss, then led by John North Willys, began development of the K-12 engine.
A 224 kW (300 hp) engine weighing less than 454 kg (1,000 lb) was a great challenge. So it was not surprising that the aluminum monoblock and several other advanced features, including the reduction gearing, presented substantial problems, appearing in various stages of the development process.
Unable to overcome these difficulties, Kirkham left Curtiss in 1919. However, development continued under Arthur Nutt, and a derated CD-12, without the reduction gearing of the K-12, resulted in 1921. This further developed into the 1922 D-12, a successful engine for both racing and fighter aircraft.
Designer Jim Bede announced that his BD-5 would deliver tremendous performance at a minimal cost, particulary to those who purchased and built the kit designed for amateur construction. Tremendous enthusiasm for the airplane could not overcome a significant weakness in the design: the lack of a suitable engine. The ultimate failure of concept should not obscure the many original and innovative aspects of the design.
In 1935, this Curtiss Robin established a world record for sustained flight, using air-to-air refueling. After two unsucessful attempts the year before, Fred and Algene Key took Ole Miss up from Meridian, Mississippi on June 4 and did not touch the ground again until July 1, for a total time in the air of 653 hours and 34 minutes, or 27 days. During the flight, the Keys received fuel and supplies 432 times from another aircraft. They braved severe thunderstorms and an electrical fire in the cabin before returning to a safe landing in Meridian.
The Curtiss Robin series was produced in the late 1920s and early 1930s as a 3-plane general aviation aircraft. Ole Miss varies from a typical Curtiss Robin by virtue of modifications made for the flight, including a new fuel tank, engine servicing catwalk, and a sliding top hatch for receiving supplies in flight.
The Laser Ranging Retroreflector is a device that reflects light so that the paths of the reflected rays are parallel to those of the incident rays. Instruments placed on the lunar surface were used in experiments to reflect laser light back to Earth. The reflected light was used to provide precise measurements of the distance between the earth and the moon.
The Bendix Corporation donated this traning unit to the Museum in 1972.
The Huff-Daland Duster was designed in 1925 for a new method of controlling agricultural insect pests, aerial crop dusting. The Huff-Daland Manufacturing Company modified its sturdy Petrel military biplane with a large hopper for chemicals and spraying equipment and established the nation's first aerial dusting business, Huff-Daland Duster Company of Macon, Georgia and later, Monroe, Louisiana.
C.E. Woolman took over the company in 1928 and renamed it Delta Air Service (forerunner of Delta Air Lines) to reflect the addition of mail and passenger service in Travel Airs. The remains of two of the original 14 Dusters stayed in storage until 1967 when Delta Air Lines selected one of them for restoration. Its registration number is unknown.
Boeing 247-D
The world’s first modern airliner, the Boeing 247 revolutionized air transportation when it entered service with United Air Lines in 1933. With its sleek, low-wing, all-metal construction; retractable landing gear; and supercharged, air-cooled engines, the Boeing 247 was 50 percent faster than its competitors. Its innovative design launched a new generation of commercial airliners, notably the Douglas DC-2. The Boeing 247-D version pioneered the use of controllable-pitch propellers and wing de-icer boots.
The airplane on display above is the first production 247-D. Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn flew it in the 1934 England-to-Australia International Air Derby, better known as the MacRobertson Race. The airplane placed third overall and second in the transport category, completing the 18,180-kilometer (11,300-mile) journey in just under 93 hours. It was returned to United Air Lines and flown as the airline’s flagship until replaced by DC-3s.
The airplane is displayed with its racing numeral, NR 257Y, and its commercial registration, NC 13369.

This is a flight spare for the sensor system carried on the Orbiting Geophysical Observatory V (OGO-V) satellite designed to measure the energy characteristics in the radiation belts surrounding the Earth. The long boom carries a set of special antennas which sent their signal to a small pre-amplifier attached to the base of the boom. From there the signal went into the main body amplifier (Catalogue #19860561000). This apparatus was manufactured by the Space and Technology Group of TRW; the firm donated it to the Museum in February 1985.
OGO-V was the fifth in a series of standardized spacecraft capable of performing many related geophysical experiments during the middle 1960s. The sensor formed part of an experiment that measured the electrostatic and electromagnetic plasma properties of the region of space from the upper ionosphere to the solar wind. The flight model of the plasma wave detector was placed in orbit from Cape Kennedy on March 4, 1968. Data from this instrument provided the first evidence for the shock wave observed in the solar wind as it encounters the Earth's magnetic field, the so-called bow shock.
Germany and Great Britain went to war in 1939 with jet aircraft programs well underway, but the United States took longer to appreciate and develop the new technology. By 1943, mounting combat losses of American strategic bombers to German propeller-driven interceptors, and the knowledge that Germany was preparing to field the potent Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter (see NASM collection), encouraged the United States Army Air Forces (AAF) to push for a new combat jet. AAF leaders asked the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation to develop the aircraft.
Lockheed's most capable engineer, Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, and a team of designers began work on a prototype, designated the XP-80 but nicknamed "Lulu-Belle," on June 21, 1943. To keep the work secret, Johnson walled off the production area with discarded engine crates and a circus tent. Someone nicknamed this site the "Skunk Works" after the still that made moonshine, hidden deep in the cartoon backwoods of Al Capp's "Lil' Abner." "Lulu-Belle" flew on January 8, 1944, and later starred in a series of exercises conducted to develop tactics that American heavy bomber crews could use against attacks by jet fighters. The trials showed that enemy jet fighter pilots would much prefer rear aspect attacks. Based on these findings, AAF planners moved the formations of American fighters protecting the bombers to higher altitudes. These tactics proved effective in fending off Me 262 attacks during the last months of the war and undoubtedly saved the lives of many American bomber crewmen. In 1949, the AAF transferred the aircraft to the Smithsonian Institution.
This device is the oldest surviving liquid-propellant rocket in the world. It was designed and built by U.S. rocket experimenter Robert H. Goddard in Worcester, Massachusetts. It was Goddard's first in which the motor was placed at the base, instead of in the nose. He had used the latter configuration on the world’s first liquid-propellant rocket to fly, which he launched on 16 March 1926. The May rocket likely includes the nozzle from that historic vehicle. His attempt to launch his new rocket on 4 and 5 May 1926 was not successful, as it did not have enough thrust to lift itself.
The Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation for the Promotion of Aeronautics gave this rocket to the Smithsonian in 1950.
Cierva C.8W
In 1928, Harold Pitcairn imported Juan de la Cierva's latest Autogiro, the C.8W (also known as the C.8 Mk.IV) to the United States as an experimental testbed for his own line of rotary-wing aircraft. This aircraft, as the first of its type in the United States, generated considerable interest in commercial and governmental circles. It validated Pitcairn's interest in the new category of aircraft and inspired other American pioneers to enter the field. The C.8W deserves recognition as the progenitor of the American gyroplane and as the first successful rotary-wing aircraft to fly in the United States.
The word "Autogiro" is a proprietary name coined by Juan de la Cierva. His designs were the first aircraft to fall in the gyroplane category. Nonetheless, nearly all gyroplanes built from the 1920s through to the end of World War Two became commonly known as "autogiros" (or the more generic "autogyros"), regardless of the manufacturer. A gyroplane is an aircraft that derives most, if not all, of its lift from the unpowered autorotation of a horizontally mounted rotor or rotors. Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical "jump" takeoffs.
Most of the early gyroplanes were similar in layout to single-engine low-winged monoplanes, with the exception of the rotor mounted on a pylon in front of the cockpit that provided the primary source of lift during slow-speed flight. They employed standard airplane-type control surfaces (elevator, aileron, and rudder) and the rotor blades all maintained a fixed pitch. The stubby monoplane wing did not serve primarily for the generation of lift. Rather, it was a convenient means of mounting the ailerons and providing stability. It also had the unintended benefit of making the aircraft appear more conventional to skeptical airplane operators who were doubtful about flying without fixed wings.
Cierva constructed his first Autogiro, the coaxial rotor C.1, in 1920. As the rotors on the C.1 autorotated at different speeds, rendering the aircraft incapable of controlled flight, he decided to switch to a single rotor design. However, the abortive first flight of the new aircraft revealed a problem that he had not considered. As the Autogiro began to gain speed during its takeoff roll, the rotor blade that was turning towards the front of the aircraft received the benefit of additional airspeed because of the forward motion of the Autogiro. However, the blade retreating towards the rear of the autogiro suffered a loss in its airspeed relative to the oncoming air for the same reason. The net effect was a difference in airspeeds of the two blades that naturally caused asymmetry of lift between the two sides of the rotor disc (as lift is a function of airspeed). In turn, this resulted in the Autogiro rolling into the retreating blade side. A subsequent Cierva Autogiro also suffered the same problem and failed to take off successfully.
In 1922, Cierva conceived an inspired solution to his problem. By incorporating a hinge that allowed each blade to "flap" independently at its root, he developed a rotor that equalized lift amongst all of the blades, regardless of whether the Autogiro was flying fast or slow. When the advancing blade generated additional lift because of its higher velocity, the flapping hinge allowed it to rise, which effectively reduced the angle of attack of the blade, thus reducing its lift. On the other side of the rotor, the flapping hinge allow the retreating blade to descend with its reduced lift, which effectively increased its angle of attack, thus generating more lift. This breakthrough was not only an essential component for the Autogiro - it was also necessary for the development of the practical helicopter.
Cierva's first successful Autogiro (and the first successful rotary-wing aircraft of any kind), the C.4, took flight on January 17, 1923 at Getafe airfield in Madrid, Spain. Over the next three years, Cierva made progressive improvements that resulted in the standard monoplane configuration for gyroplanes that remained in use until the mid-1930s. The greatest improvements came in the design of the rotor blades and the hinges, both of which would later prove essential for helicopters.
Cierva constructed his first C.8 model, the C.8V, in close association with A.V. Roe & Co. Ltd. (commonly known as Avro). The airframe was based on the fuselage of the Avro 552A, a variant of the venerable Avro 504 biplane. The most innovative component of the C.8V was its new four-bladed cable-braced rotor that incorporated drag hinges to reduce the stresses on the blades. The "V" in the model designation indicated the type of engine used in the variant - in this case, a Wolseley Viper. Cierva constructed six different C.8 configurations, all of which were experimental testbeds built to test improvements in autogiro technology before a production model, the C.19, was to appear in 1929. Given the limited knowledge of rotary wing aerodynamics of the time and the necessity of relying on trial-and-error methods, it is not surprising that Cierva constructed two dozen experimental autogiros before he completed a model worthy of production.
The most powerful of the six C.8s constructed was the two-seat C.8W fitted with a 220 horsepower Wright Whirlwind J-5. Cierva had equipped the aircraft with an American engine at the request of its buyer, Harold Pitcairn. As a teenager, Pitcairn had developed a fascination with the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft and had avidly followed news of Cierva's progress. In 1924, he had established himself in the aircraft manufacturing industry by building rugged biplanes, one of which, the PA-5 Mailwing (see NASM Collection), was to gain a legendary reputation amongst pilots who flew the nascent airmail routes. Nonetheless, Pitcairn pursued his dream to enter the then highly dubious field of rotary-wing aviation. In 1925 and 1926 he traveled to England for discussions with Cierva about either license-building Autogiros or using them as the basis of his own helicopter designs. While there with his engineer, Agnew Larsen, Pitcairn viewed film footage of the aircraft in operation. They observed that, while the Autogiro was capable of landing in short distances within a confined space, it also required considerable amounts of high-speed taxiing to build up sufficient rotor rpm to take off. Clearly, the ability to land short was of little value without the capability to take off from the same terrain. Nonetheless, Pitcairn remained interested, and in the summer of 1928 he returned to England and flew in the C.8, which greatly impressed him. A rope sling pulled by a ground crew spun up the rotor of the C.8 to near takeoff rpm, which meant that less taxiing was required before a takeoff of only (100 ft). Pitcairn decided to purchase one of the experimental Cierva C.8s as a testbed for his own company's rotary wing program.
European engines turned counter-clockwise when viewed from the rear, while the American Wright Whirlwind J-5 turned clockwise, which caused Pitcairn some apprehension over its affects on rotor rpm. After Cierva confirmed that this would not be an issue, Pitcairn agreed to purchase a new C.8 with the Wright engine. On December 11, 1928, the C.8W arrived in the United States onboard the S.S. Aquitania. Pitcairn planned to have the Autogiro make its flight on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Wright brother's first powered flight, on December 17, at his Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania airfield. However, he was conservative when dealing with the experimental testing of the newly reassembled aircraft and was extremely anxious that all should go well on the first flight. Thus, not until December 18, would the C.8W perform the first flight of a gyroplane in the United States, with Cierva test pilot, Arthur "Dizzy" Rawson at the controls. Pitcairn himself flew the aircraft the following day. Whatever doubts Pitcairn had concerning the potential of rotary-wing aircraft evaporated as he completely reorganized his company to support autogiro production. His first step was to acquire the American patent rights to Cierva's innovations and to manage and license them under the direction of the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of America. This enterprise, later renamed the Autogiro Company of America, would remain separate from the production side of Pitcairn Aircraft, which would become the Pitcairn Autogiro Company, Inc. in 1933.
Testing of the C.8W proceeded well, but it was immediately apparent to Pitcairn and his staff that the aircraft required substantial improvements in performance before it could hope to become a commercial success. One problem was that rotor flapping was unchecked, so that at speeds greater than 161 kph (100 mph) it was possible for the rotor to strike the fuselage - with catastrophic results. By the end of 1929, a three-degree reduction in the angle of incidence of the autogiro's fixed wing reduced this hazard significantly by altering the attitude of the aircraft in flight. Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in). The modification worked extremely well, and was a staple on almost all winged autogiros until the advent of wingless, direct-control versions.
Pitcairn focused on developing his own, more powerful, design, with an improved mechanism for bringing the rotor up to speed so that the aircraft would possess true short takeoff and landing capabilities. His engineering team experimented with new tail designs for the C.8W, developed by Cierva for the C.19, which deflected propwash upward into the aft section of the rotor disc. This helped to bring the rotors into a state of autorotation in preparation for a minimal takeoff run.
At the end of the 1920s, the JN-4 Jennys of the barnstorming era had given way to larger and faster aircraft that required airfields more substantial than a simple cow pasture. The minimal takeoff and landing rolls of Pitcairn's proposed Autogiros promised that the well-to-do could operate from their lawns, while conventional aircraft were becoming increasingly tied to the fixed infrastructure of the local airfields. Unfortunately, Pitcairn's timing was technically fortuitous but commercially disastrous as his new autogiro venture coincided with the advent of the Great Depression. Despite the best efforts of numerous entrepreneurs, general aviation was to remain the purview of the wealthy throughout this period and the company struggled to survive. Most of the company's Autogiro sales were to demonstration pilots who made their living performing at airshows and using the aircraft as a highly visible flying billboard, either on its own or towing banners.
Nonetheless, Pitcairn did succeed in improving on the C.8W and placing a number of variants into limited production with slightly fewer than 100 airframes constructed over a ten-year period. The C.8W did much to publicize the Autogiro during the development of Pitcairn's initial design, the PCA-1 (see NASM Collection). By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration. Also in the audience was the Spanish ambassador, who had come to see one of his nation's greatest aeronautical contributions in action. Two years later, Pitcairn's first production model, the PCA-2, would land on the South Lawn of the White House.
The development of the PCA-1 proceeded steadily, but slowly, as the challenge of scaling-up the C.8W was much more significant than a mere increase in the dimensions. One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s.
In 1930, the National Aeronautic Association awarded Pitcairn the prestigious Collier Trophy because of his pioneering flights in the C.8W and the successful Americanization of the Autogiro in the form of the PCA-1. After the C.8W finished its useful life as a testbed upon completion of the PCA-1 series of experimental Autogiros, it lay dormant for a brief time. Pitcairn then decided to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution's repository of historic aircraft at the urging of Paul Garber, who attended to the Smithsonian's aeronautics collection. The last flight of the C.8W occurred on July 22, 1931, when Pitcairn test pilot Jim Ray landed the aircraft on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian "Castle" after a 209-kilometer (130-mile) flight from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles Abbott, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, personally accepted it into the national collection. The aircraft currently awaits restoration and display. Harold Pitcairn stated at the presentation that "the time is fast approaching when the air will hold a vast number of similar but more perfected machines, all engaged in the everyday social and commercial activities of our people." The gyroplane was unquestionably a safe and economical means of solving the short takeoff and landing problem that had troubled aeronautical engineers for decades. However, the type's limited payload and low airspeeds usually made it a poor substitute for conventional airplanes in the eyes of most operators. Unfortunately, the Autogiro failed to become a widespread commercial success. The advent of the commercial helicopter in the 1940s, with its unique ability to hover, quickly displaced the gyroplane as the predominant rotary-wing aircraft.
In terms of Autogiro design, the C.8W was largely unremarkable. However, the publicity generated by the aircraft, as well as the technical knowledge gained by Pitcairn during its use, guarantees its status as a true pioneer of rotary-wing flight. Its legacy lives on, as the practical helicopter was only possible through the introduction of rotor hinges and effective blade designs that Pitcairn and Cierva had perfected on their Autogiros.

First flown in late 1938, the Boeing 307 was the first airliner with a pressurized fuselage. It could carry 33 passengers in great comfort and cruise at 6,096 meters (20,000 feet), while maintaining a cabin pressure of 2,438 meters (8,000 feet). This enabled the Stratoliner to fly above most bad weather, thereby providing a faster and smoother ride.
The Stratoliner incorporated the wings, tail, and engines of the Boeing B-17C bomber. The wide fuselage was fitted with sleeper berths and reclining seats. Ten Stratoliners were built. The prototype was lost in an accident, but five were delivered to TWA and three were purchased by Pan American Airways. TWA owner Howard Hughes purchased a heavily modified version for his personal use. The airplane displayed here was flown by Pan American as the Clipper Flying Cloud. Boeing restored it in 2001.

In 1944, at the age of 19, Stanley Hiller, Jr. designed, built, and test flew the first helicopter with coaxial rotors to fly successfully in the United States. The XH-44 was also the first helicopter to fly successfully with all-metal blades and a rigid rotor. Hiller used the counter-rotating coaxial configuration to distinguish his designs from Sikorsky's single main rotor designs that dominated the helicopter industry in the mid-1940s.
The first tie-down tests of the XH-44 took place on his parents' driveway and the initial flight tests occurred at the University of California at Berkeley's football stadium, where Hiller was a student. He initially tested the XH-44 with amphibious floats in his family's swimming pool. Up-scaled coaxial Hiller designs failed to sell, but his company prospered with the introduction of the popular UH-12 single rotor model.
Air show pilot and aerobatic champion W. W. "Woody" Edmondson thrilled audiences with his Monocoupe 110 Special throughout the 1940s. Edmondson, who named the airplane Little Butch for its bulldog-like appearance, placed second to "Bevo" Howard and his Bücker Jungmeister in the 1946 and '47 American Aerobatic Championships, but he won the first International Aerobatic Championship in 1948.
The Monocoupe 110 Special was a clipped-wing version of the 110, part of a line that began with Don Luscombe's Mono 22 and continued with the 70, 90, and 110 models. The sport coupes of the 1930s, these fast and maneuverable aircraft were ideal for racers Phoebe Omlie and Johnny Livingston. Ken Hyde of Warrenton, Virginia, restored Little Butch prior to its donation to the Smithsonian.
The Pitts S-1S Special biplane reigned as the ultimate competition aerobatic aircraft in the early 1970s. The U.S. Aerobatic Teams of 1970 and 1972 won the world team championships flying the Pitts S-1S almost exclusively. It remains one of the world's most popular aircraft for basic to advanced category competition, aerobatic training, and sport flying.
In 1960 Curtis Pitts introduced the homebuilt Pitts S-1S as a more competitive version of the S-1C Pitts Special, a small but highly maneuverable aerobatic biplane. The agile S-1S has four ailerons to boost the roll rate, and its symmetrical airfoils allow it to perform maneuvers in any orientation. The S-1S went into factory production in 1972. J. Dawson Ransome built this airplane in 1969 and donated it to the Museum in 1973.
The Autosyn was a system developed by the Eclipse-Pioneer Division of the Bendix Aviation Corporation to eliminate the cumbersome plumbing required for instrumentation in increasingly large aircraft. Instead of having many feet of piping, vulnerable to blockage or leaks, the autosyn system used a transmitter located at the source of the input that converted the mechanical or electro-mechanical impulses from a sensor into electrical signals that were sent to a standardized indicator on the instrument panel. The indicator would have a simple easily mounted face that was appropriate to the input sensed by the transmitter.
C.H. Willis, Henry Ford’s Chief Engineer, who also led the DePalma Manufacturing Company, worked with famous inventor and General Motors executive Charles F. Kettering to develop this engine under an Army contract for the Kettering Bug, a flying bomb. This predecessor for later cruise missiles used a two-cycle engine because of its high power-to-weight ratio, simplicity of construction, and low cost. With twice the explosions, a two-cycle engine can produce higher power than a four-cycle engine, but does not throttle well, which was not important for this application.
The Bug was to cost about $575 in large quantities, and have a range of fifty miles. Development of the aircraft was begun in 1918; but did not go into production because of largely unsuccessful flight tests in 1918 and 1919. The engine also powered Dayton-Wright aircraft such as the T-4 Messenger, another prototype aircraft that lost favor following World War I.
Glenn Curtiss of Hammondsport, New York, who built and raced bicycles early in the twentieth century, later raced, designed and built motorcycles and motorcycle engines. In 1904, a 5.2 kW (7-hp) Curtiss air-cooled engine powered a small dirigible, his first entry into aviation. Later in that decade, to achieve higher power, Curtiss developed liquid-cooled engines for aviation. A 1931 merger of the two famous aeronautical pioneers formed the Curtiss-Wright Corporation.
The Conqueror was an outgrowth of the famous D-12, which had largely resulted from Curtiss collaborations with Charles B. Kirkham and Arthur Nutt, and was the last of the Curtiss liquid-cooled engine series to enter production. Between 1931 and 1937, 681 Conqueror engines were manufactured with both direct and geared drives that powered high-performance military and racing aircraft. The geared Conqueror G1V-1570-F powered the Douglas YO-31A and C, Douglas XO-35 and Y1O-35, and Douglas Y1O-43.
Anne Morrow Lindbergh wore these radio headphones as she flew with her husband Charles to the Orient in 1931 and on survey flights across the North and South Atlantic in 1933. Anne, who served as co-pilot, operated all of the radio equipment during the Lindberghs' two trans-global flights, performing an impressive daily workload, and set a telegraph transmission distance record. She worked hard to learn Morse code and earn her radio operator's license, thus felt slightly insulted when women reporters seemed most interested in her clothes or where she packed the lunch boxes on the airplane. Charles, however, always recognized her importance to their success and called her "the crew," a term that made her proud.
Radio equipment was extremely important to the Lindberghs on their trans-global flights. They were flying over vast stretches of unchartered territory in Canada, Alaska, and Siberia during their 1931 flight and Greenland, Africa, and Brazil during their 1933 flight, thus they relied on radio and navigation equipment to help them find their remote destinations.
Project engineer Peyton M. Magruder designed the Glenn L. Martin Company's B-26 Marauder in response to an Army Air Corps specification issued in January 1939. This specification also caught the attention of North American Aviation, Inc., and that firm responded with the B-25. War fever caused the Air Corps to forego a prototype test stage and both bombers went from the drawing board straight into production. The consequences were deadly for men flying the Martin bomber. The Army threatened to withdraw the aircraft from combat, but Marauder crews stuck with their airplane. By war's end, they had lost fewer airplanes than almost any other combat unit and compiled a notable war record.
The NASM B-26B-25-MA named "Flak-Bait" (AAF serial number 41-31773) survived 202 combat missions over Europe, more than any other American aircraft during World War II. Workers at the Baltimore factory completed "Flak-Bait" in April 1943, and a crew flew it to England. The AAF assigned it to the 449th Bombardment Squadron, 322nd Bombardment Group (nicknamed the 'Annihilators'), and gave the bomber the fuselage identification codes "PN-O." Lt. James J. Farrell of Greenwich, Connecticut, flew more missions in "Flak-Bait" than any other pilot. He named the bomber after "Flea Bait," his brother's nickname for the family dog.
Robonaut 1A is a remotely operated, experimental astronaut assistant developed by NASA and DARPA to handle tools and other small objects. In 2011 NASA sent Robonaut 2 to the International Space Station. After onboard testing with Robonaut 2, a later version may go to work outside the space station. It would be operated by an astronaut who remains inside, minimizing the risk to astronauts for exterior repairs and maintenance of the station. Robonaut 2 tweets from the International Space Station as @AstroRobonaut. NASA transferred Robonaut 1A to the Museum in 2014.
After making a reputation with lighter-than-air craft, Thomas Scott Baldwin turned to heavier-than-air flying machines in 1909. By 1911 he had built several airplanes and had gained extensive experience as an exhibition pilot. He began testing a new airplane in the spring of 1911. It was similar to the basic Curtiss pusher design that was becoming quite popular with builders by this time, but it was innovative in that it had steel-tube structural components. It was powered by a 60-horsepower Hall-Scott V-8. Baldwin called his new machine the Red Devil III, and thereafter each of his airplanes would be known as a Baldwin Red Devil. Baldwin built approximately six Red Devils. Most were powered by the Hall-Scott, but Curtiss engines were also occasionally used. By mid-1911, Baldwin was training pilots, taking up passengers, and performing regularly with Red Devil aircraft at air meets. He advertised Red Devils for sale into 1913.
The Apollo Lunar Sample Return Container (ALSRC) was an aluminum box with a triple seal manufactured by the Nuclear Division of Union Carbide. It was used on Apollo lunar landing missions to preserve a lunar-like vacuum around the samples and protect them from the shock environment of the return flight to earth. An aluminum mesh liner helped absorb impacts. Prior to flight, each box was loaded with sample container bags and other sample containment devices. The "rock box" was then closed under vacuum so that it would not contain pressure greater than the lunar ambient pressure. On the moon, while samples were being loaded, the seals were protected by a Teflon film and a cloth cover which were removed just prior to closing the box. Two ALSRC's were used on each mission.
This ALSRC was used in July 1969 during Apollo 11, the first manned lunar landing mission, by astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin. The sample-laden container was opened under controlled conditions in the Lunar Receiving Laboratory at the Houston Manned Space Center. It carried 21.8 kg (47.7 lbs) of lunar material from the Sea of Tranquility.
It was transferred from NASA to the Smithsonian and placed on display in 1970, soon after its historic mission.
This metallic heat shield panel was made for the X-33 reusable launch vehicle research project that NASA and Lockheed carried out from 1996-2001. The purpose of the project was to evaluate technologies for a successor vehicle to the Space Shuttle. Researchers targeted the thermal protection system for improvement and innovation, seeking a more durable and more easily installed heat shield that would require less maintenance than Shuttle tiles. This lightweight metallic heat shield panel, made of Inconel and titanium, would lock together with others to form an armor layer on the vehicle. Such a metallic shield was deemed a viable alternative to ablative shields or ceramic tiles. However, NASA shelved this approach to thermal protection when it cancelled the X-33 project, and the Museum acquired a sample panel for its heat shield collection.
The McDonnell FH-1 Phantom was the first U.S. jet aircraft to take off from and land on an aircraft carrier, and subsequently it became the first U.S. jet fighter in operational service with both the Navy and Marine Corps. Its development during World War II was a major technological achievement that played a significant role in transforming U.S. aircraft at sea from piston power to jet propulsion.
Robert M. Stanley completed the Nomad in June 1938 in San Diego, California, during a stint in the U. S. Navy. He wrote down general specifications for the sailplane in 1935, and continued to refine the design while serving aboard the USS Ranger. Stanley finished building the Nomad in the basement and yard of a house he shared with other Navy personnel.
With no previous experience flying sailplanes, Stanley first flew the Nomad at the 1938 National Soaring Contest at Elmira, New York. After he landed in a field at the end of a cross-country flight, a souvenir hunter stole the elevator control surfaces. Stanley replaced the conventional tail with one of the first V-tails seen on an aircraft.
Stanley returned to Elmira in 1939 and he flew the Nomad to a new American altitude record, 4,987 m (16,400 ft), that more than doubled the old record. The next day, July 4, Stanley broke the record again, climbing to 5,254 m (17,284 ft) inside a towering thundercloud. Stanley became president of the Soaring Society of America in 1940, but he did not design and build another sailplane. He worked for the Bell Aircraft Corporation as that firm's chief test pilot during the war, and he made the first flight in America's first jet aircraft, the Bell XP-59 (see NASM collection).
This is a 1:34 scale model of the Saturn V and its launch tower. The Saturn V was one of several rockets developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for use in the Apollo program. America's largest operational launch vehicle, a Saturn V first launched a manned Apollo spacecraft in December 1968 when the crew of Apollo 8 were placed into lunar orbit. In July 1969, the rocket sent astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edward Aldrin, Jr. of Apollo 11 to the surface of the moon, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit. Saturn V was utilized in the remaining six Apollo missions to the moon during 1969-1972 and to launch the Skylab Orbital Workshop into Earth orbit in May 1973. David Gianakos built this model and donated it to NASM in 1975.
Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, purchased this Primus portable stove at Baker Lake, Canada, a remote trading post northwest of Hudson Bay, during their 1931 flight to the Orient. They also brought it on their 1933 survey flights across the North and South Atlantic.
Lodging and meals were provided at the Lindberghs' planned stops, but they still had to consider what they would eat in case of an emergency landing. They took enough canned rations to last them several weeks, but even that might not have been enough. They were traveling over vast expanses of uninhabited territory and there was no telling how long it would take to find the nearest outpost after an emergency landing. If their canned rations ran out, they would need a way to cook whatever food they could find (or catch with their fishing gear). For that reason, they took along this portable stove plus an aluminum pot and frying pan. They planned to use gasoline from the plane as fuel for the stove.
During their 1933 trip the Lindberghs shipped the stove home from Southampton, England. They no longer needed it since they would only be flying over populated areas and open ocean from then on. They also had to start lightening their airplane's load because they would need to take extra fuel on their flight across the South Atlantic Ocean. They also sent home supplies from Lisbon, Portugal and Bathurst, Gambia, until their plane was finally light enough for the Atlantic crossing.
All of the Apollo missions ended with splashdown in the ocean and recovery by specially trained teams from the U.S. Navy. Astronauts were lifted into hovering Navy helicopters by means of rescue nets attached to hydrolic hoists.
This Air Rescue Net was used December 27, 1968, to recover the Apollo 8 astronauts and it was taken out of service following the rescue. The U.S. Navy transferred it to the Smithsonian in 1969.
From August 9 to December 10, 1947, Clifford Evans and George Truman circled the globe in their Piper Super Cruisers, covering 35,897 kilometers (22,436 miles), the first time light personal aircraft accomplished such a feat. Evans flew the City of Washington while Truman flew the City of The Angels, now at the Piper Aviation Museum in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania.
The PA-12 was a more powerful J-5 Cruiser, with an electric starter, navigation lights, and a cabin heater. For the flight, Piper Aircraft arranged for second-hand planes and extra fuel tanks while radio and navigation equipment were also donated. Evans built a drift meter for each aircraft. Flags of each nation they visited were hand-painted on the fuselages' left sides and 53 of 55 city stops on the right sides.
This Detroit Aero Engines artifact is one of several engines designed by Fred Weinberg of Detroit, Michigan. Intended as an affordable power plant for amateur aviators throughout the U.S, it was built during 1910 and 1911, with one thousand or more claimed to be sold. Many fewer were believed to be used in completed airplanes.
This biocapsule carried Baker, a female squirrel monkey, during the first flight to recover a primate from space. On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Baker and Able (a female rhesus monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The capsule was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960.
Stan Corcoran's TG-1A (Training Glider Model 1A) was the first aircraft selected to train U.S. Army glider pilot cadets to fly the Waco CG-4A combat assualt glider. The Waco could be difficult to handle with heavy loads, and a skilled pilot was required to fly it. Until late in the war, Wacos were only produced in limited numbers, and none were available for training. Before bidding on producing the TG-1A, Stan Corcoran had produced gliders for the civilian market at his Frankfort Sailplane Company factory. In May 1942, the firm won a contract to build 40 TG-1As. Production began immediately, and the order was completed by November 1942. Each glider cost $2,775 to build but Corcoran's factory lacked the resources to quickly produce large numbers of gliders. The Schweizer Aircraft Corporation easily built many more TG-2 gliders, a design similar to the TG-1A. By war's end, nearly 1,100 dedicated military training gliders were completed.
Beginning in the 1960s, the United States Navy began developing a communications and navigation satellite program to meet the needs of ships at sea and submarines. One result of this program was the Transit satellite series, designed and built to Navy specifications by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland.
Submarines received radio signals from a Transit satellite, whose orbit was known to great accuracy, as it passed overhead. The change in frequency of the signal due to the Doppler effect told the submarine that the satellite was directly overhead. The submarine commander could establish a position without having to surface and take reading on stars--the traditional method of navigation, but a risky one for a submarine.
The Transit V-A satellite is an operational backup to the Transit series and was donated to NASM by the JHU Applied Physics Lab in late 1984.
This medal was awarded to Dr. Sally K. Ride by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in recognition of the STS-7 space shuttle flight. At the same ceremony where she received the medal, Ride donated her flown STS-7 flight suit to the museum.
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the medal to the Museum in 2013.
This two-chambered, liquid-fuel rocket engine built by North American Aviation served as the booster for the Navaho missile that was powered by two ramjets. The booster was to quickly get the missile up to supersonic speed for its ramjets to operate. Each chamber produced 120,000 pounds of thrust, or 240,000 pounds total, using kerosene and liquid oxygen as propellants.
Navaho had a 8,850 kilometer (5,500 mile) range. It never became operational and was canceled in 1957. However, its booster-rocket engine was extremely important in the evolution of American large-scale, liquid-fuel engines, including those for the Redstone, Jupiter, Thor, and Atlas missiles, the Saturn V launch vehicle, and the Space Shuttle. This object was donated to the Smithsonian in 1970 by Rocketdyne.
This chemical slide rule used for determining the mass of atoms and molecules belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. Before pocket-sized electronic calculators became available in the 1970s, slide rules were used as an aid to complex mathematical operations. Ride used this device as a university student.

The Model 905 was the second of the early aircraft engine designs of the Packard Motor Car Company, located in Detroit, Michigan. Following the Model 299 built in 1915, Packard built three Model 905 engines between 1916 and 1917. The design of both engines followed Packard's twin-six automotive engine. Packard engineers J. G. Vincent and W. B. Stout, under the observation of the U.S. Army, developed the Model 905.
The Model 905 was a liquid-cooled V-12 rated at 168 kW (225 shp). Mounted on the platform of a two-ton truck for testing, the propeller projected over the rear end. The propeller thrust drove the truck forward at more than 64 km/hr (40 mph). With no muffler installed, the loud noise attracted a considerable amount of attention around the Packard factory causing the police department to order it off the streets.
Hawker Chief Designer Sydney Camm's Hurricane ranks with the most important aircraft designs in military aviation history. Designed in the late 1930s, when monoplanes were considered unstable and too radical to be successful, the Hurricane was the first British monoplane fighter and the first British fighter to exceed 483 kilometers (300 miles) per hour in level flight. Hurricane pilots fought the Luftwaffe and helped win the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1940.
This Mark IIC was built at the Langley factory, near what is now Heathrow Airport, early in 1944. It served as a training aircraft during the World War II in the Royal Air Force's 41 OTU.
Charles B. Kirkham of Savona, N.Y., one of the earliest and best known airplane engine designers and builders, originally built motorcycle engines, and did casting and machining for Glenn Curtiss, whose Hammondsport factory was nearby. Between 1910 and 1912, Kirkham designed and built his own engines. From 1915 to 1919, he was Chief Engineer for the Curtiss Airplane and Motor Corporation; later founding his own company.
Kirkham designed, tooled up, and built this engine in 1929. It is believed to be the first vertically-opposed air-cooled engine. It was an experimental design and was equipped with a supercharger. Although it may have been a good engine, there apparently were no suitable airplanes for its unconventional shape.
This is a 1/24th scale model of Ranger 1 and 2, the spacecraft series that sought to gather knowledge about the Moon in the first yearsof the space age, and which gave scientists their first close look at the lunar surface. Rangers 1 and 2 were test missions in Earth orbit, although neither of them were successful in 1959 and 1960. Later versions of this spacecraft, Rangers 7, 8, and 9, were successful in the middle part of the 1960s in reaching the Moon and returning imagery of its surface. Those pictures revealed details that could not be seen through telescopes on Earth.

This silver cup was presented to Dr. Sally K. Ride by the Kentucky Blue Grass Chapter of the Ninety-Nines. The Ninety-Nines is an international organization founded in 1929 for the mutual support and advancement of female pilots. At the time of the club's founding, there were only 117 licensed female pilots, 99 of whom accepted the invitation to become charter members, hence the club's name. Ride also owned a Ninety-Nines pin which is in the Museum's collection.

Like the Wright brothers, who followed, John Stringfellow and his associate William Henson are an important link to early aeronautical researchers. At an exposition in 1868 in London's Crystal Palace, where it powered a triplane model along a cable, the Aeronautical Society of Great Britain awarded a prize of £100 to Stringfellow’s engine as the lightest in proportion to its power, producing 0.75 kW (one horsepower) for the weight of 5.9 kg (13 pounds).
In 1889, Smithsonian Secretary Samuel P. Langley purchased the engine, along with a "car" designed to carry an engine and a pair of propellers, for £25. Langley held on to the engine briefly, sending it to L.D. Copeland of Smithville, N.J., for experimental work. Upon return of the engine to Langley, he turned it over to the museum section of the Smithsonian for public display, also in 1889.
The Arado Ar 234 B Blitz (Lightning) was the world's first operational jet bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. The first Ar 234 combat mission, a reconnaissance flight over the Allied beachhead in Normandy, took place August 2, 1944. With a maximum speed of 735 kilometers (459 miles) per hour, the Blitz easily eluded Allied piston-engine fighters. While less famous than the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighters, the Ar 234s that reached Luftwaffe units provided excellent service, especially as reconnaissance aircraft.
This Ar 234 B-2 served with bomber unit KG 76 from December 1944 until May 1945, when British forces captured it in Norway. Turned over to the United States, it was brought to Wright Field, Ohio, in 1946 for flight testing. In 1949 it was transferred to the Smithsonian, which restored it in 1984-89. This Arado is the sole survivor of its type.
In 1916 Curtiss engineer Charles Kirkham began designing an engine to compete with the Wright Corporation's Hispano-Suiza. By late 1917, the prototype K-12 (K for Kirkham) was bench tested. While it met its design objectives of high power, low frontal area, compact size, and low weight, the engine encountered technical difficulties during development. Kirkham left Curtiss in 1919, and Arthur Nutt took over the project, eventually producing the D-12, which became a highly successful racing and military power plant in the 1920s.
This engine is manufacturer's number 5 out of about 20 built. The K-12 powered the Curtiss Navy 18T Wasp triplane and the Army Curtiss 18B Hornet biplane. In 1919 Curtiss test pilot Roland Rholfs set a new world's altitude record of 10,641 m (34,910 ft) with the 18T.
The GLU-925 Multi-Mode Receiver (MMR) is the first certified example of an integrated navigational system that incorporates signals from multiple types of navigational and landing systems, including GPS [WAAS and LAAS], GNSS, VOR, MLS, ILS, and integrating them into a single presentation and using the combination of signals to verify the accuracy of others. This allows an air-transport aircraft to use the most adventageous form of navigation, without having to add additional equipment, regardless of where they are in the world. Different nationalities often favor different technologies, sometimes for purely political reasons. The GLU-925 marks the first time that a navigational set has been certified for LAAS capability. LAAS utilizes a GPS differential to provide precision vertical azimuth guidance during landing. This allows air-tranpsort aircraft to make "Cat III" type blind landings with significantly less infrastructure than previous ILS-based procedures. This system will allow much lower landing minimums at a far greater number of airports and will improve the the efficiency of air traffic networks.
In 1935 Wiley Post scavenged this aperiodic compass from the older Winnie Mae for use on his new plane, a Lockheed Orion. Post lost his life when the airplane crashed. The compass was recovered during the investigation.
Nicknamed Tante Ju, or "Auntie Ju," the Junkers Ju 52/3m was a successful European airliner. Designed for Deutsche Luft Hansa in 1932, the Ju 52/3m was a tri-motor version of the single-engine Ju-52. It could carry 17 passengers or 3 tons of freight and had good short-field performance. By the mid-1930s, airlines throughout Europe and Latin America were flying them. In World War II, they were the Luftwaffe's primary transports, and some served as bombers.
A total of 4,835 Ju 52/3ms were built, including 170 under license by Construcciones Aeronauticas (CASA) in Spain and more than 400 by Ateliers Aeronautiques de Colombes in France. This airplane is a Spanish-built CASA 352-L. Lufthansa German Airlines acquired it for promotional flights, then donated it to the Smithsonian in 1987.
This aluminum cooking pot was among the equipment Charles Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, took on their 1931 flight to the Orient and 1933 survey flights across the North and South Atlantic. Lodging and meals were provided at the Lindberghs' planned stops, but they still had to consider what they would eat in case of an emergency landing.

This Lindbergh Eagle award was given to Dr. Sally K. Ride in May 1985 to honor her achievement as the first American woman in space. Anne Morrow Lindbergh, widow of the famed aviator Charles A. Lindbergh, presented the award at a ceremony during Minneapolis' Lindbergh Heritage week. Lindbergh, who had often flown with her husband as a co-pilot, navigator, and radio operator, modestly declined the comparison made between herself and Ride as flight "pioneers," saying that Ride was more deserving of the title. Also in attendance were Alan Shepard, the first American in space, and Apollo astronauts Russell "Rusty" Schweickart and Donald "Deke" Slayton.

Insitu ScanEagle X200
This ScanEagle remotely piloted aircraft (or drone) served Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) demonstrations from 2013–2015 to integrate Unmanned Aircraft Systems into the U.S. national airspace. It performed ice floe monitoring missions in northern Alaska, and beyond visual line of sight validation flights, including railroad track inspection in New Mexico. The ScanEagle was the first drone to receive an FAA restricted category type certificate.
The ScanEagle evolved from engineer Tad McGeer’s project in the late 1990s, to develop a scout for tuna fishing fleets. The aircraft launches by catapult and recovers (guided by differential GPS) upon flying into a cable suspended from a crane. It is caught out of the air by its wingtip. Since 2004, the ScanEagle has seen extensive military service overseas in the tactical observation role, most notably with the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps.

This Eastman Kodak 35mm camera is the same as the ones used to take pairs of close-up photographs of the lunar surface. When the camera’s base was placed on the Moon's surface and the trigger under the handle pulled, the camera would photograph the area beneath its lenses. The resulting photographs would give a three dimensional or stereoscopic effect when placed in a special viewer.
This item was transferred to the Smithsonian in 1974.
Arch rival to the U.S. F-86 in Korea, the MiG-15 shocked the West with its capabilities. The Soviets designed the aircraft in 1946 to answer an urgent need for a high-altitude day interceptor. It first flew in late 1947. The MiG-15 was the first Soviet jet to benefit from the British sale to Russia of the new Rolls Royce Nene and Derwent jet engines, which the Soviets immediately copied and refined. The resulting RD-500, Klimov RD-45, and modified VK-1 engines gave a powerful boost to Soviet jet technology.
The MiG-15 featured the first production swept wing, pressurized cockpit, and ejection seat on a Soviet aircraft. Although Mikoyan and Gurevich were aware of German turbojet and swept-wing work, this design was wholly Russian, except for the engine. This MiG-15bis is a Chinese Ji-2 modification. The Smithsonian acquired it in 1985.
Before achieving fame in aeronautics, Glenn Curtiss started his career with motorcycles. The early aviation community began to seek out Curtiss because of his growing reputation for designing powerful, lightweight motorcycle engines. In 1906 he designed his first V-8 engine in response to several requests from early aeronautical experimenters.
As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V-8. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine. The Curtiss V-8 was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the massive engine. Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907. He recorded a record-setting speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during his run. He was dubbed "the fastest man on Earth."
Fighter Squadron Eighty-Four, "Jolly Rogers."
This is the WAC-Corporal liquid-fuel sounding rocket, the U.S.'s first successful sounding rocket. Developed from 1944 at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, it could lift 25 pounds of instruments to 20 miles. The motor used nitric acid and aniline and produced 1,500 pounds of thrust. The first rocket was launched in 1945.
However, captured German V-2 rockets soon became available that could carry heavier payloads to higher altitudes. The WAC was thus little used. One was placed on top of a V-2, however, as part of the U.S.'s first experimental two-stage liquid propellant rocket series called Project Bumper. One Bumper in 1949 went up to a record 244 miles. This rocket was donated to the Smithsonian by Caltech in 1959.
On 20 June 2002, Lawrence "Pete" Lehmann set a world record for the longest hang glider flight to a declared goal when he flew this Wills Wing Talon 150 a distance of 516.2 km (321 miles) from Zapata, Texas, to Big Lake, Texas. Lehmann's 9-hour goal flight, which he had to declare before taking off, exceeded the previous record by 16.1 km (10 miles). He reached a maximum altitude of 2,736 m (9,000 ft) above sea level.
This is one of the first U.S. air-cooled, radial aircraft engines, an original design, entirely hand built by Henri L. Albisser about 1909. It powered an aircraft that he also designed, built, and flew in Rahway, New Jersey at that time.
Before emigrating to the U.S. in 1905, Albisser was employed by the early French automobile manufacturer Peugot. He opened Rahway’s first garage, and kept busy assisting the town’s other four automobile owners. In 1908 he built and flew his first airplane, powered by a 2-cylinder, 9 kW (12 hp) engine and a 183 cm (6-ft) propeller. Seeking more performance, he built this engine the following year, with an aluminum crankcase and a 244 cm (8-ft) propeller, enabling him to fly as high as 183 m (600 ft) for as long as 10 minutes.
In 1920 Albisser joined Chrysler and assisted construction of the first Chrysler automobile. This artifact was later displayed in his own DeSoto automobile agency.
Still shrouded in secrecy over 35 years after its creation, the Lockheed U-2 was originally designed as a strategic reconnaissance aircraft, playing a crucial role during the tense years of the Cold War. Built by the famous ‘Skunk Works" by Lockheed under the direction of Clarence L. "Kelly" Johnson, the U-2 was truly one of the most successful intelligence- gathering aircraft ever produced. The U-2 on display at NASM flew the first operational mission over the USSR on 4 July 1956, piloted by Hervey Stockman.
On November 23, 1935, explorer Lincoln Ellsworth, with pilot Herbert Hollick-Kenyon, took off in the Polar Star from Dundee Island in the Weddell Sea and headed across Antarctica to Little America. Fuel exhaustion forced them to land 40 kilometers (25 miles) short of their goal on December 5, and they walked for six days to reach their destination. They settled in the camp abandoned by Richard E. Byrd several years earlier.
The British Research Society ship Discovery II sighted them on January 15, 1936, near the Bay of Whales. Hollick-Kenyon later returned to recover the Polar Star. The dent in the fuselage behind the engine was caused by a hard landing on the polar ice. The total distance flown by the Polar Star before its forced landing was about 3,862 kilometers (2,400 miles).
Salmson aircraft engines, produced in France starting in 1913 by the Societe des Moteurs Salmson in Billancourt, Sein, were originally designed and patented by Canton and Unne, and also constructed in Great Britain by the Dudbridge Iron Works, Ltd. of Strand, Gloucester. Development work began in 1908, making it one of the earliest companies to produce radial power plants. Except for being water-cooled, the Salmson engines demonstrated the advantages of the radial concept, being the first successful large aircraft engines of this type.
The Salmson Z-9 was the first of its series, and was produced during World War I. It primarily powered Salmson-built aircraft, principally the Salmson 2 SAL day reconnaissance bomber used by American squadrons in 1918. The French-built Z-9 also powered Rep, Voisin, Caudron, Farman, Hanriot, and Spad aircraft. The 9ZM, built by the English firm of Willans & Robinson, powered the Vickers F.B.27 Vimy prototype.
Attack Squadron Sixty-Five, "Fighting Tigers."
This pressure altimeter would have given Gemini astronauts an indication of their altitude as they returned to Earth from space. It was used for testing and was not flown. The altimeter is similar to those used on aircraft, and can measure altitudes up to 80,000 feet (24 km). Early plans for Gemini were to have the capsule return to a runway, using a folding wing designed by Francis Rogallo. The capsule would therefore have required a suite of instruments similar to those of a winged saircraft. After testing, however, the wing was abandoned in favor of a parachute desent into the ocean, like the previous Mercury and subsequent Apollo spacecraft returned.
NASA transferred this altimeter to the Museum in 1973.
This Jefferson Award medal was presented to Dr. Sally K. Ride by the American Institute of Public Service in 1984. Founded in 1972 by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Senator Robert Taft Jr., and Sam Beard, the Jefferson Award is the country’s longest standing and most prestigious celebration of public service. Ride was one of four winners that year, chosen specifically for the Samuel S. Beard Award for "Greatest Public Service by An Individual 35 Years or Under."
Sally Ride became the first American woman in space when she flew aboard STS-7 in 1983. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. A physicist with a Ph.D., she joined the astronaut corps in 1978 as a part of the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger disaster in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” but known popularly as the Ride Report.
After she retired from NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego. Until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company that promoted science education.
Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated the medal to the Museum in 2013.
This silver trophy bowl was awarded to Dr. Sally K. Ride in 1965, recognizing her second place finish in a tennis tournament in central California when she was fourteen years old. Ride took her first tennis lesson in 1961, and she quickly became a talented and dedicated player. She entered the private Westlake School for Girls in 1965 on a partial tennis scholarship and also went on to become a nationally-ranked tennis player as an undergraduate at Swarthmore College and Stanford University. She briefly considered becoming a professional player, but decided to concentrate on a career in science instead.

This Northrop T-38 training jet model belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride. NASA kept a small fleet of T-38s for astronaut training, proficiency, and transportation, and for use as chase planes. As a mission specialist astronaut, not a pilot, Ride was expected to spend fifteen hours a month aloft in the backseat of a T-38, practicing navigation and communication procedures while conditioning herself for high performance flight. Ride, who had previously flown only on commercial airliners, so enjoyed flying in the T-38 that she took lessons and earned her pilot license.

The 1917 French twin-engine Caudron G.4 has great significance as an early light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. It was a principal type used when these critical air power missions were being conceived and pioneered in World War I. Although fighter aircraft frequently gain greater attention, the most influential role of aviation in the First World War was reconnaissance. The extensive deployment of the Caudron G.4 in this role makes it an especially important early military aircraft. Moreover, despite its speed and armament limitations, the Caudron G.4 was quite reliable, had a good rate of climb, and was pleasant to fly, all characteristics that made it a good training aircraft after its combat effectiveness was reduced. Many Allied pilots received their initial flight training on the Caudron G.4. The NASM Caudron is among the oldest surviving bomber aircraft in the world, and one of the very few remaining multi-engine aircraft from this period.
The Wright brothers inaugurated the aerial age with the world's first successful flights of a powered heavier-than-air flying machine. The Wright Flyer was the product of a sophisticated four-year program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in 1899. After building and testing three full-sized gliders, the Wrights' first powered airplane flew at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903, making a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft), with Orville piloting. The best flight of the day, with Wilbur at the controls, covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds.
The Wrights pioneered many of the basic tenets and techniques of modern aeronautical engineering, such as the use of a wind tunnel and flight testing as design tools. Their seminal accomplishment encompassed not only the breakthrough first flight of an airplane, but also the equally important achievement of establishing the foundation of aeronautical engineering.
During the 1920s William J. Powell led a small group of black air enthusiasts in Los Angeles. He established the Bessie Coleman Flying Club in 1929 and sponsored the first all-black air show on Labor Day 1931. As part of his effort to make aviation accessible to African American students, he taught classes on aeronautics at the Bessie Coleman Flying Club. This flight computer was among the equipment he used while teaching.
This biocapsule carried Able, a female rhesus monkey, during the first flight to recover a primate from space. On May 28, 1959, an Army Ballistic Missile Agency Jupiter rocket at Cape Canaveral launched Able and Baker (a female squirrel monkey housed in a separate capsule) in its nose cone. Their biomedical condition was monitored throughout the flight as part of Department of Defense experiments to determine the effects of spaceflight on living animals. They reached an altitude of approximately 300 miles, a maximum speed of 10,000 mph, and were recovered alive some 1,500 miles downrange by U.S. Navy ships. The flight provided important biomedical data for the human spaceflight program. The capsule was built by the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, which transferred it to NASM in 1960.
This diesel engine was designed and built under the direction of the Packard Company’s Chief Aeronautical Engineer, L. M. Woolson. The objective was to achieve greater safety and economy through the substitution of heavy oil (furnace oil) for gasoline as fuel.
Approved Type Certificate No. 43 was issued by the Department of Commerce on March 3, 1930, and the engine was publicly shown for the first time during the Detroit Aircraft Show in April 1930. Between May 25 through 28, 1931 at Jacksonville, Florida, a world's non-refueled duration flight record of 84 1/2 hours was set. The Model DR-980 won the 1931 Collier Trophy.
The Packard Diesel DR-980 was the first compression ignition, oil-burning engine flown. It powered such aircraft as the: Stinson SM-1DX Detroiter; Packard-Bellanca Pacemaker; Verville Air Coach; Ford 11-AT-1 Trimotor; Goodyear Defender airship; Towle FA-3 Flying boat; Stewart M-2 Monoplane; Waco Taper Wing; and Consolidated XPT-8A aircraft.
This Sally Ride Science pin was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. She served as president and CEO of the company which she founded in 2001 along with Dr. Tam O'Shaughnessy, Dr. Karen Flammer, and two like-minded friends. The company was created as a response to the gender gap seen in science and technical fields. Young girls have the same aptitude and enthusiasm for science as boys, but Ride believed that they tend not to pursue science later in life because of cultural stereotypes and lack of role models. The company sought to counteract this imbalance with events, programs, and products to promote science education. The scope of Sally Ride Science was gradually expanded so that it now strives to inspire all students to a greater appreciation of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM). A Sally Ride Science polo shirt is also in the Museum's collection.

This NASA Outstanding Leadership medal and its accessories were awarded to Dr. Sally K. Ride on August 13, 1987. It is one of the most prestigious awards given by NASA, and it recognizes exceptional ability in leading people, achieving results, influencing change, and being a role model. Ride announced her retirement from NASA several months prior to recieving the award, and she left in September. Notably, in 1987 she also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic planning report in 1987 titled, “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” known popularly as the Ride Report.

This life jacket was issued to John Glenn for his Friendship 7 flight in February, 1962. The life jacket is the self-inflating tube-type Navy issue life jacket made of rubberized nylon. It was strapped to his chest with the convex mirror fastened to the front.
The mirror had the dual purpose of a reflecting mirror in case of mission abort when the astronaut could use the mirror to attract rescuers. The other use was for reflection of the instrument panel in order to enable the staff of Mission Control to take instrument readings.
Transferred to the National Air and Space Museum from NASA in 1967.
New Horizons will be the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and the Kuiper Belt in the outer solar system. It was launched aboard an Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base, Florida, on January 19, 2006, and conducted a Jupiter flyby 13 months later to gain further acceleration. New Horizons will make its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015.
The half-ton spacecraft contains scientific instruments to map the surface geology and composition of Pluto and its three moons, investigate Pluto's atmosphere, measure the solar wind, and assess interplanetary dust and other particles. After it passes Pluto, controllers plan to fly the spacecraft by one or two Kuiper Belt objects. New Horizons carries several souvenirs from Earth, including some of the remains of Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997), discoverer of Pluto, and a piece of SpaceShipOne.
The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory donated this to the Museum in 2008.
This wind tunnel model set dates from the early Space Shuttle design effort. In 1968-1970 the Convair Division of General Dynamics evaluated the aerodynamics of both a delta wing and a straight wing spacecraft design with either a vertical or a horizontal tail. This model, which can be reconfigured with different wings, tails, and fuselage sections, is a versatile device for testing design concepts. It suggests the experimentation and craft of aeronautical engineering. The model set passed from General Dynamics to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University and then to a private collector who donated it to the Museum in 2007.
Designed to replace de Havilland DH-4s for delivering the air mail in the mid 1920s, Douglas M-2s were sturdy, dependable aircraft that were popular with the newly formed airlines.
This M-2 was flown by Western Air Express, predecessor of Western Airlines, which inaugurated air mail service between Los Angeles and Salt Lake City via Las Vegas in April 1926. It was delivered to the Post Office Department in 1926 as an M-4, which had a longer wing than the M-2 and cost $15,000. It was later reconfigured as an M 2. Western Air Express acquired the airplane in June 1927 and flew it for almost 914 hours, before the airplane crashed in January 1930. It was then resold several times and was reacquired by Western Airlines in 1940 for display.
Known as "the missile with a man in it," the stubby-winged Lockheed F-104 Starfighter was the first U.S. jet fighter in service to fly Mach 2, twice the speed of sound. Designed as a high-performance day fighter, the F-104 had excellent acceleration and top speed. It first flew on March 4, 1954.
While built for the U.S. Air Force, most Starfighters were flown by other countries, particularly Canada, Italy, Germany, and Japan. Many were built under license overseas.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) flew this F-104A for 19 years as a flying test bed and a chase plane. It was used to test the reaction controls later used on the North American X-15. This aircraft was the seventh F-104 built and was transferred to the Museum after its last flight, to Andrews Air Force Base, on August 26, 1975.
The one-of-a-kind Gulfhawk was flown from 1930 to 1936 by Al Williams, former chief test pilot for the U.S. Navy and famous aerobatic pilot. Originally built by Curtiss as a Hawk I export demonstrator with a Curtiss D-12 liquid-cooled engine, it was converted to a Hawk 1A with a Wright Cyclone air-cooled radial engine, then further modified by Williams several times. He flew the Gulfhawk in military and public air shows to promote military aviation during the inter-war years, when aviation budgets were low.
By 1933, Williams managed and flew for the aviation department of Gulf Oil Company, which painted the Gulfhawk in its familiar color scheme of orange with white and blue trim. After Williams' death, movie stunt pilot Frank Tallman restored and flew the airplane and displayed it between shows at the Tallmantz Movieland of the Air Museum.
On a dare from another pilot, Ray Stits designed and built the Sky Baby at his home in Riverside, California, to prove that he could build the world's smallest man-carrying airplane. To test fly the tiny aircraft, Stits hired Robert H. Starr who took off on the first flight in April 1952. During the spring and summer, Starr flew the SA-2A at air shows around the nation before Stits retired the airplane in November. Starr reported that the Sky Baby could top 299 kph (185 mph) at full speed and touched down for landing at about 129 kph (80 mph).
To keep the overall dimensions of the SA-2A as small as possible, Stits chose a biplane layout with negative-stagger, full-cantilever wings, and a conventional, cruciform empennage. No one disputed Stits's claim until the 1980s when Starr, the man who flew the SA-2A, announced that he had built an aircraft that was smaller than the Sky Baby. Ray's son, Donald, responded by designing the world's smallest monoplane. September 2002, the "Guiness Book of Records" acknowledged the "Bumble Bee II," built by Starr, as the world's smallest biplane, and the "Baby Bird," designed by Donald Stits, as the smallest monoplane.
The Douglas SBD Dauntless was one of the truly great aircraft of World War II. It played a major role throughout the Pacific. On June 4, 1942, during the Battle of Midway, SBDs destroyed four Japanese carriers, dramatically altering the course of the war.
The SBD's design was based on the Northrop BT-1, but with engine and structural changes. Production orders were placed in April 1939, with all SBD-1s going to U.S. Marine Corps units. Subsequent models were sent to Navy squadrons, with each succeeding model carrying such improvements as increased fuel capacity, illuminated gunsights, and armor plates for the crew. England, New Zealand, and France also used SBDs. The SBD-6 was the last production model, with 450 built.
This SBD-6 carries the markings of VS-51 (Navy scout squadron), which operated in the Pacific during World War II.
This main bus ammeter measured the current from the batteries used in Gemini 3, IV, and VI. Located on the Gemini pilot's panel, the No. 1 scale displayed main batteries 1 and 2 and the No. 2 scale displayed main batteries 3 and 4. Fuel cells replaced batteries on Gemini V and VII through XII. This ammeter did not fly in space. Weston Instruments made the artifact and NASA transferred it to NASM in 1972.
Hispano-Suiza engines were developed by Marc Birkigt, of Swiss origin, and first manufactured in Barcelona, Spain for use in automobiles. Hisso engines were very successful and featured innovative cast-aluminum cylinder construction with internal water passages. Increased demand for World War I, in particular, required licensing of Hisso aircraft engine manufacturing in France, England and the U.S. The Wright-Martin Aircraft Corporation, later the Wright Aeronautical Corporation, acquired the American rights and claimed improvements during further development.
In 1916, the Societe d'Exploitation des Materiels Hispano-Suiza of France began manufacturing Type A engines for the Spad fighter. Produced under license by Wright-Martin, this engine powered U.S. military training aircraft such as the Curtiss JN-4H.
.
Whether known as the Warhawk, Tomahawk, or Kittyhawk, the Curtiss P-40 proved to be a successful, versatile fighter during the first half of World War II. The shark-mouthed Tomahawks that Gen. Claire Chennault's "Flying Tigers" flew in China against the Japanese remain among the most popular airplanes of the war. P-40E pilot Lt. Boyd D. Wagner became the first American ace of World War II when he shot down six Japanese aircraft in the Philippines in mid-December 1941.
Curtiss-Wright built this airplane as Model 87-A3 and delivered it to Canada as a Kittyhawk I in 1941. It served until 1946 in No. 111 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force. U.S. Air Force personnel at Andrews Air Force Base restored it in 1975 to represent an aircraft of the 75th Fighter Squadron, 23rd Fighter Group, 14th Air Force.
The Apollo Command Module's primary source of electric power was from a set of three "fuel cells" housed in the Service Module. Each fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity and water. The water was used for drinking by the astronaut crew. Each of the fuel cell power plants contain 31 separate cells connected in series. Each cell has hydrogen and an oxygen compartments and electrodes, which in combination produce 27 to 31 volts. Normal power output for each power plant is 563 to 1420 watts, with a maximum of 2300 watts.
This particular fuel cell was installed in Service Module (SM) 102 during ground testing and operations conducted at the module's North American Aviation manufacturing site in California. It was transferred to the Smithsonian in September 1972. SM-102 was not flown.
With the successful crossings of the Atlantic in 1919 by the U.S. Navy's NC-4 and Alcock and Brown in a Vickers Vimy, circumnavigation of the globe by airplane was a natural next challenge. In July 1923, U.S. Army Air Service disclosed that it intended to attempt a global flight the following year. Four specially built aircraft were commissioned from the Douglas Aircraft Company. The World Cruisers, as they were called, were christened the Seattle, the Chicago, the Boston, and the New Orleans.
Only the New Orleans and the Chicago completed the arduous 44,085 km (27,553 mi) flight. It took 175 days, with a flying time of 371 hours 11 minutes. Throughout the journey the crews prevailed against an endless series of forced landings, repairs, bad weather, and other mishaps that continually threatened the success of the flight. A monumental logistical accomplishment, it was an important step toward world-wide air transport.
Manufacturer's model
Bill Bennett, the hang gliding pioneer who founded Delta Wing Kites and Gliders in 1969, lost his leading designer, Richard Boone, in 1982. Without Boone, the company was hard-pressed to remain in the technological race to sell innovative, high-performance hang gliders. Bennett hired a new chief designer, Robert England, and immediately put him to work designing a new competition hang glider design to replace the aging Phoenix Viper (see NASM collection).
England produced the Streak. It was the most advanced Delta Wing hang glider yet built, but the design embodied nothing new. England borrowed heavily from the Ultralite Products Comet introduced two years earlier. The area covered by the lower wing fabric increased again over previous models, to more than 87 percent. This covering could also be completely removed to ease assembly or to inspect and service the internal structure.
One of the most exciting aerobatic aircraft of the 1930s and '40s, the Grumman Gulfhawk II was built for retired naval aviator and air show pilot Al Williams. As head of the Gulf Oil Company's aviation department, Williams flew in military and civilian air shows around the country, performing precision aerobatics and dive-bombing maneuvers to promote military aviation during the interwar years.
The sturdy civilian biplane, with its strong aluminum monocoque fuselage and Wright Cyclone engine, nearly matched the Grumman F3F standard Navy fighter, which was operational at the time. It took its orange paint scheme from Williams' Curtiss 1A Gulfhawk, also in the Smithsonian's collection. Williams personally piloted the Gulfhawk II on its last flight in 1948 to Washington's National Airport.
From 1962 to 1964, NASA used the Paresev to develop the technology for landing the two-man Gemini capsule on land, instead of parachuting into the ocean, as had been done in Project Mercury. The astronauts would release an inflatable paraglider wing based on the work of Francis Rogallo, and maneuver to a runway or dry lake bed. Astronauts "Gus" Grissom and Neil Armstrong were among those who piloted the Paresev during several hundred flights at Edwards Air Force Base in California. The Paresev was towed by a ground vehicle or a small aircraft and released at an altitude between 5,000 and 12,000 feet. It was tested with three different wings; the 1-A is the first configuration. Before the paraglider concept could be fully developed for the Gemini program, NASA decided to stick with the proven technology of parachutes and water landing.
NASA transferred the Paresev to the Smithsonian in 1968.
An early predominant manufacturer in the United States, Spencer Heath's American Propeller and Manufacturing Company opened in Baltimore in 1909. Heath was first to use machines for mass production of aircraft propellers and, under the Paragon trademark, these were widely used in World War I. Like most propellers of that era, construction was a wood laminate because of light weight, strength, fabrication ease, and resistance to fatigue in a vibrating and flexing environment.
Heath demonstrated the first "engine-powered, engine-controlled, variable and reversible pitch propeller" in 1919, but was unsuccessful in convincing the Army of the practicality of the concept. He sold the company to the Bendix Corporation in 1929 and retired from aeronautics two years later.
This propeller was thought to be used on the Army's first airship, a Curtiss-Baldwin of 1908.
NASA used this Space Shuttle orbiter concept model in wind tunnel tests to learn about the flight characteristics of the vehicle's shape. Although the orbiter would spend most of its time in space, its aerodynamic shape would affect its passage through the atmosphere during launch and descent. This straight wing model would have less cross-range maneuverability during final descent; that is, without engine power during the downward glide, it would have to complete its descent very close to a runway. However, straight wings meant a lighter-weight orbiter and less surface heating during reentry. NASA transferred a variety of wind tunnel and concept models to the Museum after settling on the final Space Shuttle design.
This device was part of the Crew/Vehicle Disturbance experiment flown aboard the Skylab space station launched by the United States in 1973. The purpose of the experiment was to determine the effect of crew activities on the vehicle's stability by measuring the forces, torques, and vehicle motions caused by the astronauts' movements. As an astronaut stood on the unit or moved between units, precise measurements of his motions and resultant forces on the vehicle structure were sent the ground for comparison with vehicle attitude and pointing control data to analyze disturbances. This extra device was stowed aboard the backup Skylab orbital workshop that NASA transferred to the Museum.
The J-5 Whirlwind was a cornerstone aviation technology of the 1920s and 1930s. Charles L. Lawrance began work on the J-series of compact, lightweight, air-cooled radials for the U.S. Navy in 1921. The Navy merged Lawrance's firm with Wright Aeronautical in 1923 to further develop and manufacture the new engines. The J-5 had such advanced features as sodium-cooled exhaust valves and aluminum cylinder heads designed by engine pioneer Sam D. Heron.
The Whirlwind became the engine of choice for America's long-distance and exploratory fliers, including Charles Lindbergh, who chose a J-5 for the Spirit of St. Louis. This artifact, a military R-790-A, was the center engine on the Army Air Corps Fokker C-2 tri-motor “Question Mark,” which pioneered aerial refueling by setting an endurance record of 150 hours and 40 minutes over Los Angeles in 1929.
In order for John Glenn to take photographs during his February 20, 1962 mission while still wearing his bulky spacesuit, NASA engineers modified a Leica camera with this special viewfinder. This special attachment featured a suction cup on the back side to allow Glenn to easily place the device against the visor when he was required to keep it down. The viewfinder was removeable for when Glenn did not need his visor down, and the velcro strip on the rounded top let him manage its location inside the spacecraft.
NASA transferred this rangefinder to the Museum along with all other Friendship 7 equipment in 1967.

Among the most successful early engines marketed in the United States were those designed and built by aviation pioneer and inventor Glenn Curtiss in his factory at Hammondsport, New York. Early Curtiss engines powered motorcycles, and were air cooled. Later, to achieve higher power, Curtiss began to develop liquid-cooled engines. Curtiss built this engine for the U.S. Navy in 1921 for experimental purposes. It incorporated the Ricardo supercharging system, designed to increase engine power at high altitude and decrease fuel consumption.
The piston and cylinder assembly were designed so the underside of the piston compressed air on the intake stroke of the piston. The compressed air then passed through an intercooler back into the cylinder above the piston during the compression stroke. The Navy did not consider the experiment successful, as the improvements that resulted did not offset the increased weight and mechanical complexity.
This aviator helmet belonged to Dr. Sally K. Ride, who became the first American woman in space when she flew on the STS-7 shuttle mission in 1983. As a scientist astronaut rather than a pilot, Ride trained for flight in the backseat of a Northrop T-38 training jet, learning navigation and communication procedures. This is one of the helmets she wore on those flights. She so enjoyed the experience of flying that she took private lessons and earned her pilot license. Dr. Ride’s partner, Dr. Tam O’Shaughnessy, donated this helmet to the Museum in 2013.
A physicist with a Ph.D., Sally Ride joined the astronaut corps in 1978 in the first class of astronauts recruited specifically for the Space Shuttle Program. Her second and last space mission was STS-41G in 1984. Viewed as a leader in the NASA community, she served on the Rogers Commission after the Challenger accident in 1986 as well as the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) in 2003. She also led the task force that produced a visionary strategic plan in 1987, titled “NASA Leadership and America’s Future in Space,” known popularly as the "Ride Report." After she left NASA in 1987, Dr. Ride taught first at Stanford and later at the University of California, San Diego, where she also served as the director of the California Space Institute. From 2001 until her death in 2012, she was president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, a company she founded to promote science education.
The United States possessed no combat-worthy aircraft upon entry into World War I in 1917. Several European aircraft were considered. The British DH-4 was selected because of its comparatively simple construction and its apparent adaptability to mass production. It was also well-suited to the new American 400-horsepower Liberty V-12 engine. American-built DH-4s were dubbed the "Liberty Plane." By war's end, 13 Army Air Service squadrons, five of them bomber squadrons, were equipped with them. In addition, four combined Navy-Marine squadrons were flying DH-4s along the Belgian coast. Of the 4,346 DH-4s built in the United States, 1,213 were delivered to France, but of those only 696 reached the Zone of Advance. In the postwar period, the DH-4 was the principal aircraft used by the U.S. Government when air mail service began in 1918.
The DH-4 in the NASM collection was the prototype American-built DH-4, manufactured by the Dayton-Wright Airplane Company. This airplane was used in more than 2,600 experiments until its retirement in April 1919. On May 13, 1918, Orville Wright made his last flight as a pilot in a 1911 Wright Model B alongside this DH-4, flown by Howard Max Rinehart. He then made a flight as a passenger in the DH-4 with Rinehart.
Formed in 1906 to produce automobiles, Rolls-Royce was asked to begin designing and building aircraft engines at the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Design of the Merlin began in 1933 following the similar Kestrel design. Early Merlin Mk II and Mk III engines, which produced about 7,457 kw (1,000 horsepower), powered Hawker Hurricanes and Supermarine Spitfires in the Battle of Britain. Engine improvements and progress in supercharger performance increased the Merlin's rated power to over 1,715 kW (2,300 horsepower) by the end of the war.
This engine, a developmental prototype in the Merlin 100 series, was built by Rolls-Royce in Derby, England, sometime between June and July 1944. It was a new class of engine, built to higher performance standards for power and altitude. Merlin 100s powered the de Havilland Mosquito, Avro Tudor, and de Havilland Hornet and Sea Hornet. U.S. Packard-built Merlin 100s (V-1650-9 and -11) powered later versions of the North American Mustang.
