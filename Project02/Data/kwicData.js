Nirmaier had adhered closely to Mignet's plans in constructing the aircraft, deviating only in the methods used to weld several parts. Powel's daughter, Page, christened the plane La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) using a bottle containing water from the Atlantic Ocean near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina.

The V.11 was largely the creation of Fokker's chief designer, Reinhold Platz. Platz was the true creative force behind the famous Fokker fighters of the second half of the war. He did most of the fundamental design work on the firm's aircraft after 1916. Anthony Fokker's talents were greater as a test pilot than as a designer. He had an innate ability to fly an experimental aircraft and know just what improvements needed to be made to turn it into a successful performer. This intuitive sense on the part of Fokker, combined with Platz's innovative preliminary designs, made them a formidable team. Fokker's ego and dominating personality frequently led him to understate Platz's role as the genuine innovator of the designs that bore the Fokker name, and he took undue credit for himself. Nevertheless, there is no denying the important contributions Fokker made to bringing Platz's designs to final form. This was especially true in the case of the Fokker D.VII.  "

The Model 1031 proved relatively stable, and easy to handle when hovering. A natural self-correcting tendency in forward flight was noted. This occurred because the forward lip of the duct would generate more lift than the trailing edge causing an upward pitching moment.

Without these items, a helicopter's useful load increases by a significant margin. These components are also potential failure points, making helicopters more fragile and more difficult to maintain. Yet another advantage is the substantial reduction in the cost to produce helicopters without this equipment. In 1948, Stanley Hiller began to experiment with ramjets mounted on the tips of the main rotor blade. He hoped to make small, ramjet-powered helicopters practical and affordable, and to eventually design and sell giant aerial cranes propelled by ramjets or jet turbine engines. The Hiller HOE-1 became the first production ramjet helicopter, and the Army and Navy flew a small number of these aircraft for a short time to test and evaluate the technology.  "

He then incorporated the results into a new line of hang gliders called the Phoenix series. On these gliders, Bennett increased the leading-edge convergence angle from 80 to more than 95 degrees. Total wing surface area was slightly less than standard Rogallo models, but the aspect ratio (wingspan to wing chord ratio) increased substantially. The first Phoenix hang gliders flew with a long fantail, a device thought to improve stability. As Bennett continued to develop the Phoenix series, he increased the leading-edge convergence angle even further, and removed the fantail after flight experience showed that it did not increase stability. The docile handling characteristics and good stability of the Phoenix VI made it a popular trainer at hang glider flying schools. More experienced pilots also favored this model type because it flew relatively fast, had good rough air penetration and handling characteristics, and the glider could soar on updrafts far better than earlier standard Rogallo designs. This success encouraged Bennett to develop the Phoenix series further, and variations continued to appear well into the 1980s.  "

The pilot, seated before a stick and rudder bar, had just four instruments: oil temperature, oil pressure, nonsensitive altimeter, and tachometer. The single-seat C-2 was powered by a two-cylinder Aeronca E-107 engine rated at 26-30 hp. In 1929, the Aeronca C-2 sold for $1,495. By mid-1930, the price had dropped to $1,245 as a result of the depression. C-2s were economical at 1 cent a mile for oil and gas, and they could often be rented for just $4.00 an hour. Furthermore, they were simple to fly, easy to maintain, and had no bad characteristics to spring on a novice pilot.

Smith, a pioneer in military aviation, took this camera on the Douglas World Cruiser 1924 world flight. Smith was born on October 8, 1892 and graduated from San Fernando College in 1912. Three years later, Smith joined the Aviation Service in the Mexican Army before returning to the United States in 1917 to enlist in the Aviation Section of the Signal Corps. After World War I, Smith began his record setting career when he placed second in the Transcontinental Reliability and Endurance Contest from New York to San Francisco. In 1923, he finished third in the Liberty Engine Builders Race in St. Louis, Missouri. Smith and Lieutenant John Richter set a new world record in August of the same year. With the help of in-flight refueling, they flew non-stop for 37 hours and 11 minutes in a DH-4 over San Diego. For this, he received the Distinguished Flying Cross. The round-the-world flight that made Smith famous was accomplished in 1924 for the U.S. Army Air Service. Five Douglas World Cruisers were specially-built for the project. The aircraft were named Seattle, Chicago, Boston and the New Orleans and also included a prototype for test flights. The flight commander, Major Frederick L. Martin, flew the Seattle. Smith, Lt. Leigh Wade and Lt. Erik H. Nelson piloted the Chicago, the Boston, and the New Orleans, respectively. The crew took off from Seattle on April 6, 1924, but soon ran into trouble when Martin crashed over Alaska.

Planetary scientist and JPL director Bruce Murray complained at the time of Viking about the lander being ballyhooed as a definite means of ascertaining whether or not life existed on Mars. The public expected to find it, and so did many of the other scientists involved in the project. Murray argued that \u201cthe extraordinarily hostile environment revealed by the Mariner flybys made life there so unlikely that public expectations should not be raised.\u201d Murray believed that the legacy of failure to detect life, despite the billions spent and a succession of overoptimistic statements, would spark public disappointment and perhaps a public outrage. Murray was right. The immediate result was that NASA did not return to Mars for two decades.

It featured a streamlined semi-monocoque fuselage, with an almost fully-enclosed 160-horsepower in-line Mercedes engine, and the propeller spinner neatly contoured into the nose of the fuselage. A sesquiplane version with narrow-chord lower wings, designated the D-III, was introduced early in 1917, and served with great success, despite the narrow lower wing being susceptible to frequent failure in prolonged dives. The Albatros D.V model was fitted with a more powerful 180-horsepower engine, but was plagued by a rash of upper-wing failures. The wings were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va. Unfortunately, the necessary strengthening increased the weight and negated the performance advantage of the new engine. The D.V and D.Va also continued to experience the same lower wing failure problems in a dive similar to the earlier D.III. A small auxiliary strut was added at the bottom of the outer wing struts to address the issue, but was not entirely successful.  "

The AAF designated them YP-80As and sent two each to England and Italy as Me 262 pilots began to take their toll of Allied bomber crews. A fast and reliable foil to the deadly Messerschmitt was sorely needed. However, not enough production P-80 fighters, or crews trained to fly them, were available to equip a front line squadron. An AAF order raising the production priority to the highest level, equaling priority for Boeing B-29 Superfortress bombers (see NASM collection), could not speed quantity manufacturing. The rush to field the brand new fighter may have lead to several fatal accidents. Among those killed in P-80s were Lockheed test pilot Milo Burcham and America's top ace and Medal of Honor winner, Major Richard I. Bong. After World War II, the P-80 \"Shooting Star\" became a fine, reliable frontline fighter. A highlight of the type's service record occurred came on November 8, 1950, when Lt. Russ Brown, flying an F-80C of the 16th Fighter Interceptor Squadron, shot down a North Korean MiG-15 in the first all-jet air-to-air combat.  "

One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s.  "

Many nosewheel strut failures delayed the transition to full operational status but the first airplanes flew combat missions in the Pacific not long after the American entry into World War II. On June 4, 1942, four Army Air Corps Marauders defending Midway island attacked Japanese aircraft carriers with torpedoes but failed to score hits. It was soon obvious that the B-25 Mitchell required less runway for takeoff and had greater range than the B-26 so U. S. Army Air Force (AAF) planners shifted all Marauders to Africa and the European Theater of Operations. The Mitchell became the preferred type in the Pacific. The 319th BG became the first Marauder outfit sent to England. During a familiarization flight, one ex-Tokyo raider crashed and the Group CO (commanding officer) and a Squadron CO became lost over France and were shot down and killed. During this mission, 18 men died, four aircraft were destroyed, and four damaged. The Army Air Forces sent Marauders on to North Africa after the Allies invaded that continent in November 1942. By the 21st of that month, the last 319th B-26 had arrived in Algeria. Out of 57 bombers that left the U. S., only 17 made it to Africa. On December 4, the new 319th Bombardment Group CO flew his first mission with the acting CO. The B-26 was hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire over the target and crashed. All survived and became POWs (prisoners of war). On December 15, the 12th Bomber Command CO, Col. Charles Phillips flew as guest pilot aboard a B-26 flown by a Squadron CO.

    text: "The initial two models of the Dauntless would see the first combat in the Pacific on 7 December 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Marine Air Group (MAG) 11 - equipped with the SBD-1 - was caught on the ground and all aircraft were either damaged or destroyed by the Japanese. At the same time, 18 Navy SBD-2s, launched from the Enterprise, which was returning to Hawaii from Wake Island, arrived just as the Japanese were attacking. Seven Dauntlesses were shot down or crash-landed. Two Japanese aircraft were claimed shot down by the Dauntlesses. Three days later the SBD gained the distinction of destroying the first Japanese warship of World War II when Lt Dickinson of VS-6 sank the Imperial Japanese submarine I-70 off of Hawaii.  "

    text: "Design engineer Dr. Donovan R. Berlin layed the foundation for the P-40 in 1935 when he designed the agile, but lightly-armed, P-36 fighter equipped with a radial, air-cooled engine. The Curtiss-Wright Corporation won a production contract for 210 P-36 airplanes in 1937-the largest Army airplane contract awarded since World War I. Worldwide, fighter aircraft designs matured rapidly during the late 1930s and it was soon obvious that the P-36 was no match for newer European designs. High altitude performance in particular became a priceless commodity. Berlin attempted to improve the P-36 by redesigning it in to accommodate a turbo-supercharged Allison V-1710-11 inline, liquid-cooled engine. The new aircraft was designated the XP-37 but proved unpopular with pilots. The turbo-supercharger was not reliable and Berlin had placed the cockpit too far back on the fuselage, restricting the view to the front of the fighter. Nonetheless, when the engine was not giving trouble, the more-streamlined XP-37 was much faster than the P-36.  "

    text: "Only the New Orleans and the Chicago completed the arduous 44,085 km (27,553 mi) flight. It took 175 days, with a flying time of 371 hours 11 minutes. Throughout the journey the crews prevailed against an endless series of forced landings, repairs, bad weather, and other mishaps that continually threatened the success of the flight. A monumental logistical accomplishment, it was an important step toward world-wide air transport.  "

    text: "American-built DH-4s had some initial problems. The pilot and observer found themselves separated by the 254-liter (67-gallon) main fuel tank. This dangerous feature not only made communication between the crew members difficult, but it was hazardous in a crash. The much-touted Liberty engine was also at first a cause for concern. The prototype was designed and built in only six weeks. Not surprisingly, they too had technical problems. Once resolved, however, with a maximum speed of 198 kph (124 mph), the Liberty-powered DH-4 was able to match or even surpass the speed of most of the fighters of the time.  "
