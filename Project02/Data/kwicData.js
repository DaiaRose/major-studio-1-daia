      text: `"This Geraldine Ferraro campaign button was owned by Dr. Sally K. Ride. Ferraro was Walter Mondale's running mate on the Democratic ticket in the 1984 presidential election, and had she been elected, she would have been America's first woman Vice President. During her acceptance speech at the party convention, Ferraro cited Sally Ride's achievement as the first American woman in space as evidence that "change is in the air." Ride saw Ferraro's nomination as inspirational, and said about the DNC speech, "I was as moved by that as many women had been by my flight into space. For the first time, I understood why it was such an emotional experience for so many people, to see me accomplish what I had, as a woman." Ride was a strong supporter of Ferraro and visited her at her congressional office a few months prior to the election, posing for photos with her and a t-shirt that Ride had given her bearing the vice-presidential insignia."`

      text: `"In addition to the near global photographic coverage of the Moon, Lunar Orbiter provided additional information that aided Apollo. Sensors on board indicated that radiation levels near the Moon would pose no danger to the astronauts. Analysis of the spacecraft orbits found evidence of gravity perturbations, which suggested that the Moon was not gravatationally uniform. Instead it appeared as if buried concentrations of mass were under the mare deposits. By discovering and defining these "mascons," Lunar Orbiter made it possible for the Apollo missions to conduct highly accurate landings and precision rendezvous.
      After depleting their film supplies, all five Lunar Orbiters were purposely crashed onto the Moon to prevent their radio transmitters from interfering with future spacecraft."`
