North American completed the NA-73 airframe 117 days later and installed an in-line, liquid-cooled Allison engine. This aircraft first flew on October 25, 1940. During flight tests, the airplane exhibited outstanding performance, particularly in level-flight speed. The British enthusiastically ordered 150 examples of the airplane and the Royal Air Force (RAF) named it the Mustang. The U. S.

With the Hawker Hurricane, it successfully defended England against the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain, and throughout the war it saw service on every major front. Performance and handling were superb. The Mk.VII, the second high-altitude version developed, was used in England and the Middle East. Several Mk 2EXVIs, the last production version to use the Merlin engine, remained in service through 1950. In all, 20,351 Spitfires were built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Spitfire was the end product of many years of design development at the Supermarine works at Woolston, England. There, Reginald J. Mitchell designed racers to enter in the Schneider Trophy Races, with the British government subsidizing the project. Mitchell designed every British winner after World War I, and on September 13, 1931, his S.6B brought the Schneider Cup permanently home to Britain by winning the third consecutive race."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Interest in high-speed competition flying lagged, but Mitchell continued to work on his designs. His seaplane racers gave way to landplane designs, incorporating such new features as an enclosed cockpit, retractable undercarriage, and the new Rolls Royce PV-12 liquid-cooled engine (later named the Merlin). With these elements, he increased the endurance and speed of his planes. The British government was now issuing specifications for fighter aircraft, which reflected its watchful eye on political developments in Germany. When a specification was issued for a fighter with eight instead of the usual four machine guns installed, Mitchell was ready with the design for the Supermarine Type 300. It surpassed Air Ministry requirements and was accepted. Another specification was written for the construction of the prototype."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On March 5,1936, Spitfire prototype K5054 took off from Eastleigh Airfield, Southhampton, on its maiden flight. After official trials at Martlesham Heath, a specification covering further development of the Spitfire was drawn up. On June 3,1936, an order for 310 planes was placed by the Air Ministry. R. J. Mitchell did not live to see his Spitfire reach production; he died of cancer on June 11,1937, at the age of forty-two. But the groundwork had now been established, and J. Smith, his chief draftsman, took his place as chief designer."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On August 4,1938, K9789, the third Spitfire off the assembly line, was delivered to the Royal Air Force at Duxford. The first squadron to be re-equipped with the new Spitfires was No. 19; No. 66, also at Duxford, began receiving them soon after. When war with Germany was declared, 400 Spitfires were already in service and 2,160 were on order. Nine fighter squadrons were completely equipped with Spitfires; two more were being converted to the fighters."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Spitfire was an all-metal cantilever monoplane. The shape of the wing, which became its most distinguishing characteristic, was elliptical, reducing drag and increasing speed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Even while the first deliveries were being made, improvements were being introduced. A metal two-blade controllable pitch propeller replaced the two-blade fixed pitch mahagony airscrew, increasing speed. A tailwheel replaced the tail skid. Bulletproof windshields were installed in Spits already in service and as they came off the production line."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Spitfire was easy to handle. It became airborne quickly, and once in the air, its maneuverability was outstanding. The combination of its speed and firepower made the Spit a deadly machine. Its eight machine guns concentrated a hail of bullets capable of tearing enemy planes at a point 300 yards in front of the craft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Since the Spitfire was designed principally as a home defense interceptor fighter, its range was limited. But in 1943 this was increased by adding external (fuel) tanks, which could be jettisoned. This modification enabled the Spitfire to escort bombers to and from targets across the English Channel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As needs arose, variations on the Spitfire were developed: photo reconnaissance versions to keep track of German movements on the continent and at sea; high-altitude versions to take on the Messerschmitt Bf.109s; low-altitude versions to meet the Focke WuIf Fw.190s. They were also employed in sea-air rescue operations. A Spitfire could quickly reach a downed pilot and drop a dinghy and emergency supplies, often saving the pilot from the cold waters of the channel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Spitfire was in service with many different groups and on many different fronts. Belgians, Free French, Poles, Czechs, Americans, and British Commonwealth countries used the fighter. The Eagle Squadron was one of the best known of these foreign units. Composed of American volunteers, the first Eagle Squadron was officially formed on October 19, 1940. They flew Hurricanes until they could be equipped with Spitfires. When the United States entered the war, there were three squadrons of Eagles. On September 29, 1942, these squadrons became the 334th, 335th, and 336th Squadrons of the 4th Fighter Group of the U.S. Eighth Air Force and were re-equipped with American fighter craft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Spitfires took part in operations in the Middle East, North Africa, India, Burma, Australia, and Russia.

The P-40 was the only American land-based fighter available at the time but it was also seriously deficient in speed, range, and altitude performance. North American declined to build it but proposed a completely original design and promised to finish it in less than three months. North American completed the NA-73 airframe 117 days later and installed an in-line, liquid-cooled Allison engine. This aircraft first flew on October 25, 1940. During flight tests, the airplane exhibited outstanding performance, particularly in level-flight speed. The British enthusiastically ordered 150 examples of the airplane and the Royal Air Force (RAF) named it the Mustang. The U. S. Army Air Corps also showed interest and in 1941 they ordered 500 ground-attack variants designated the A-36."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Early in 1942, the British tested four RAF Mustangs fitted with the two-stage, two-speed Merlin 65 engine. The supercharger in the Merlin 65 was optimized to produce sea-level horsepower up to approximately 9,150 m (30,000 ft). Urged on by Rolls Royce and British and American fighter pilots who sampled the new Mustang, North American obtained two Merlin 61 engines similar to the 65 and installed them in airframes designated XP-51Bs. The new variant had good range and outstanding speed, about 80 kph (50 mph) faster than previous models. Thus was born the world's best long-range, propeller-driven escort fighter. With improved range and speed, P-51 squadrons could now accompany 8th Air Force bombers on long-range raids over Europe. Bomber losses dropped sharply when fighters could protect them during their entire mission. The Mustang also proved itself in the Pacific theater. Again, the P-51 had the range, speed, and endurance to escort Boeing B-29 Superfortresses conducting long-range bombing attacks. The newly independent U. S. Air Force used the airplane during the Korean War for close-support, ground attack missions but it was not suited for this dangerous mission. One of the Mustang's few vulnerable spots was the cooling system. A single bullet through a radiator or pipe was usually enough to down a P-51."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"North American built more than 14,000 Mustangs and more D-models (8,302) than all other variants combined.

It was approved in 1960 to place probes in orbit around the Moon for satellite mapping. This project, originally not intended to support Apollo, was reconfigured in 1962 and 1963 to further the presidential mandate by mapping the surface. In addition to a powerful camera that could send photographs to Earth tracking stations, it carried three scientific experiments-selnodesy (the Lunar equivalent of geodesy), meteoroid detection, and radiation measurement. It helped to scout the lunar surface, down to one-meter resolution, and identify potential landing sites. The spacecraft allowed NASA mission planners to select the safest, but most scientifically interesting landing sites for the Apollo missions."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Managed by Langley Research Center, NASA eventually sent five Lunar Orbiters to the Moon on Atlas-Agena rockets in 1966-1967. While the returns from these spacecraft interested scientists in and of themselves, they were critical to Apollo. NASA launched the five Lunar Orbiter satellites between 10 August 1966 and 1 August 1967, all successfully achieving their objectives. In total, they mapped roughly 99 percent of the lunar surface. Lunar Orbiter 1 became the first spacecraft to take a picture of the Earth from the Moon, preempting the famous \"Earthrise\" photograph of Apollo 8 by more than two years. But this Lunar Orbiter image, for all of its significance did not have the salience of the more famous image in part because it was not full color. At the completion of the third mission, moreover, the Apollo planners announced that they had sufficient data to press on with an astronaut landing, and were able to use the last two missions for other activities. They conducted more general scientific surveys and also mapped the lunar gravitational field. For example, Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and 95 percent of the farside, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the farside coverage and acquired up to two-meter resolution images of 36 pre-selected areas."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The photographic system on board Lunar Orbiter was particularly unique. Instead of sending television pictures back to Earth as electrical signals, Lunar Orbiter took actual photographs, developed them on board, and then scanned them using a special photoelectric system. For this reason scientists referred to Lunar Orbiter as the \"flying drugstore.\" Due to the possibility that radiation in space would fog photographic film, a slow speed film was used. This required the spacecraft to move slightly whenever its shutters were opened to prevent blurring. The resulting images had exceptional quality and provided resolutions of up to 3 feet from an altitude of 30 nautical miles."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In addition to the broad photographic coverage of the Moon, Lunar Orbiter provided additional information that also aided Apollo. Sensors mapped the radiation levels around the Moon, analysis of the spacecraft orbits found evidence of gravity perturbations which suggested that the Moon was not gravatationally uniform. Instead it appeared as if buried concentrations of mass were under the mare deposits. By discovering and defining these \"mascons,\" Lunar Orbiter made it possible for the Apollo missions to conduct highly accurate landings and precision rendezvous."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After depleting their film supplies, all five Lunar Orbiters were proposely crashed onto the Moon to prevent their radio transmitters from interfering with future spacecraft.

The novelty of the HM.14, along with Mignet's effective marketing, compelled hundreds of people to build and fly the Pou du Ciel in France and Britain during the 1930s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Henri Mignet was born in France in 1893. He had the gift of understanding machines and technology and pursued a career in electricity. He became interested in aviation as a teenager and by age eighteen, he was corresponding with Gustav Lilienthal (brother to Otto, the famous German glider pioneer) about building aircraft. After World War I, Mignet began to experiment with powered aircraft. His first designs barely flew but in 1927 he built the HM.8, his first design capable of sustained flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the 1920s, the idea of constructing a homebuilt aircraft from published plans was popular in the United States but in Europe, the idea was unknown. In Britain and France, the established manufacturers dominated the production of powered aircraft. Mignet decided to publicize the HM. 8 in the French magazine \"Les Ailes.\" Interest in this aircraft began to grow, encouraging Mignet to write another article that appeared in \"Le Sport de l'Air\" in 1931."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To make the airplane as simple to build and fly as possible, Mignet employed some unorthodox design elements in his next major design, the HM.14. He decided this airplane could fly without ailerons, elevator, and rudder pedals, and that he would use two main wings. He mounted one on struts above the fuselage and ahead of the pilot. To control pitch, the pilot pivoted this wing by moving a control stick fore and aft. Mignet mounted a second wing firmly fixed to the top of the fuselage behind the pilot. To turn, the pilot moved a rudder surface by swinging the control stick left or right. A generous amount of dihedral built into both wings caused the airplane to automatically bank when turning. Mignet claimed that any man who could nail shut a wooden crate could build his own HM. 14."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The French press began to refer to the new aircraft as the \"Pou du Ciel,\" and the name stuck. After publishing a book in November 1934 that described in detail how to build this airplane, public interest skyrocketed. By March 1935, 500 HM.14s were under construction in France. In August, Mignet flew his HM.14 to Britain and soon gained widespread attention. Construction began on hundreds of HM.14 airplanes and builder/pilots received permits to fly more than 80. The Flea's performance appealed to many; the maximum speed of the average Flea was between 80 and 105 km/h (50-65 mph), depending on the engine, the flying weight, and the quality of construction. A pilot could fly from 80 to 161 km (50-100 miles) before needing to refuel and she could usually take off in less than about 180 m or 600 ft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the same month that Mignet introduced the \"Pou du Ciel\" to Great Britain, the first fatal crash of a Flying Flea happened in Algeria. In April 1936 the first British fatality occurred. The authorities saw pilot incompetence as a leading factor in the crashes until May 1936 when Royal Air Force Squadron Leader C.R. Davidson died. Government officials in both France and Britain banned flights and subjected the HM.14 to wind tunnel tests. The results showed that under certain flight conditions, the pilot could not recover from a dive. Based on their findings, Mignet soon modified the design and solved most of the problems but the bubble of public infatuation with the Flea had burst. He continued his efforts to produce new aircraft and built a factory in the United States to make parts, but Mignet never recaptured the initial public interest first shown the HM.14."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1935 when the Flea was near the peak of its popularity, an American entrepreneur and the president of the Crosley Radio Corporation, Powel Crosley, Junior, obtained a copy of Mignet's book \"Le Sport de l'Air.\" The airplane immediately appealed to Crosley and he ordered his personal pilot, Edward Nirmaier, to build one. With the help of Dan Boedeker and Herb Junkin, Nirmaier began construction on October 1, 1935. Funded by Crosley, he used materials readily available near the airport at Sharonville, Ohio. He even scrounged an ABC Scorpion engine. Nirmaier made the first test flight exactly one month later on November 1. This became the first HM.14 built in the United States. Nirmaier had adhered closely to Mignet's plans in constructing the aircraft, deviating only in the methods used to weld several parts. Powel's daughter, Page, christened the plane La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) using a bottle containing water from the Atlantic Ocean near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This was the site of the first successful flight of a powered, heavier-than-air flying machine, the 1903 Wright Flyer (see NASM collection). The U. S. Bureau of Air Commerce licensed the airplane as the experimental Crosley Flea."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Crosley never intended to produce the HM.14, but he was happy to promote it as the aircraft for the common man. In December 1935 Nirmaier took the Crosley Flea to the 8th annual All American Air Maneuvers airshow in Miami to show the airplane off. It flew well, but on the first day, a gust of wind flipped it over while taxiing. Nirmaier quickly repaired the damage and took the aircraft aloft for a short flight two days later. This became the Crosley Flea's last flight. Meet organizers awarded the HM.14 a trophy (see NASM collection) for efficient construction and operation, but the aircraft remained grounded for good."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Crosley's Flea remained stored in a hangar until 1939 when a fire forced workers to hastily move the airplane.

He purchased the Flea minus its wheels and engine but Pat located Ed Nirmaier and reclaimed the original wheels that Nirmaier had installed on his lawnmower. Pat donated the aircraft to the Smithsonian in about 1960.

As a manufacturer and racer of motorcycles, it was only natural for Curtiss to wonder how fast he could move on a motorcycle with his V--8 engine. He instructed his workers to construct a frame that could support the weight of the engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The frame measured nearly 2.4 m (8 ft) in length and the overall weight of the machine was 125 kg (275 lb). It was a prototype built exclusively for the Curtiss V-8 engine. Because of the size of the engine, the seat was mounted behind the power plant so that the rider would not get burned. This in turn necessitated extra long handle bars, which made steering awkward. It used an automobile rear wheel and a motorcycle front wheel. The tires were manufactured by B.F. Goodrich. The machine was not equipped with any suspension system at all. Only the small springs on the seat cushioned the operator's ride. Needless to state, the ride was anything but smooth."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Curtiss V-8 engine was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm. The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the Curtiss V-8. The motor was mounted with the crankshaft running lengthwise and was connected to the drive shaft with a double universal joint. A large bevel gear on this shaft meshed with a similar one on the rear wheel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The engine had two carburetors, each one supplying four of the eight cylinders on each side. There was no choke. The transmission was direct drive, with no clutch. The F-type cylinders were cast of special hard gray iron that was very durable. They were carefully ground and lapped to ensure near perfect compression. The cylinders were set at 90 degrees and were of two-piece design. They had a bore of 3 5/8 inches and the stroke was 3 1/4 inches. The head and pistons were also cast iron. The crankcase was of aluminum. Each of the pistons was fitted with four rings. The intake valves were automatic, atmospheric operated. The exhaust valve was push rod-operated from the camshaft. Curtiss used strong forged alloy steel for the internal components. The individual thin-wall cylinders and the head were attached to the crankcase with high tensile nickel alloy steel studs, contributing to the better-than-average lightness of the overall engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Jump spark ignition was used, energized by dry cell batteries. Lubrication was achieved by a splash system. The oil tank was located in front of the seat, holding approximately one liter (one quart) of oil. Fuel capacity was approximately 9.5 liters (2.5 gallons)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907 to make a run with the V-8. The judges agreed upon a two-mile run to get up to speed, one mile for the actual test, and two miles to stop the motorcycle. The machine's braking system was minimal, looking like something that would be found on a geared bicycle. It was a hinged paddle device on the rear tire, which did not permit a quick stop. Tom Baldwin and \"Tank\" Waters, who traveled with Curtiss, positioned themselves on either side of the machine and pushed the motorcycle until the engine started. Curtiss recorded a speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during the run. He was dubbed \"the fastest man on Earth.\""}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400046265-1","title":"Camera, Wide Angle, LROC","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9ea42e879-18b5-4f1b-892d-772e18281d12","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"The Wide Angle Camera (WAC) from the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is a CCD camera equipped with a wide baffle.

In 1926, T. Claude Ryan hired him as factory manager at the Ryan Airlines, Inc., at San Diego, California. Late in February 1927, Bowlus and twenty Ryan workmen, supervised by chief engineer Donald A. Hall and Charles A. Lindbergh, built a long-range monoplane based on the Ryan M-2. Lindbergh christened the modified M-2 the \"Spirit of St. Louis.\" It is said that Bowlus suggested several design features that Lindbergh approved and incorporated in the finished airplane. Bowlus renewed his friendship with Lindbergh late in 1929. He taught the ocean flyer and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to fly sailplanes and in January 1930, both Charles and Anne completed their first solo glider flights."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hawley Bowlus developed the Senior Albatross series from a design that he called the Bowlus Super Sailplane. In Germany, designers and pilots led the world in building and flying high-performance gliders and Bowlus was strongly influenced by their work. He and German glider pioneer Martin Schempp taught courses in aircraft design and construction at the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute in Glendale, California. The two instructors led a group of students who built the Super Sailplane in 1932. The wing of the Super was nearly a copy of the wing used on the German \"Wein\" sailplane designed and flown with great success in 1930 and 1931 by Robert Kronfeld. Both the Super Sailplane and the Senior Albatross employed the same Goettingen 549 wing airfoil and even the tips of the control surfaces curved to almost identical contours. When Bowlus built the Senior Albatross series, the cockpit enclosure closely resembled another record-setting and influential German sailplane called the \"Fafnir\" and designed by Alexander Lippisch specifically for pilot Gunther Groenhoff."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Richard C. du Pont was also an important character in the history of the Senior Albatross. By the time he finished high school, this heir to the Delaware-based chemical empire could fly gliders with some skill. During his first year at the University of Virginia, he founded a campus soaring club. His passion for motor-less flight drew him farther away from traditional academics and in 1932, he transferred to the Curtiss-Wright Technical Institute. Mr. du Pont was probably among the students who built the Super Albatross."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1933, du Pont teamed with Hawley Bowlus and the two men set up shop in San Fernando, California, to build gliders. Bowlus furnished the design expertise and performed much of the construction while du Pont supplied enthusiasm, financing, and additional labor. The Bowlus-DuPont Sailplane Company became an official entity in 1934, not in California but in Delaware. The firm folded in September 1936 but during its short life, the small factory built four examples of the Senior Albatross.

Bowlus fitted two with wing flaps, Falcon and Albatross II, rather than spoilers, for better speed and altitude control during landing. Mahogany plywood skinned the Falcon and spruce plywood covered the other three aircraft, Dragonfly, Albatross I, and Albatross II.

If it became necessary, the pilot of a Senior Albatross could push his mount well over 161 km/h (100 mph) as long as he never exceeded a speed of 241.5 km/h (150 mph). With an accomplished pilot at the controls, the Senior Albatross could fly better than any other American sailplane and they were very pleasing to look at, too. A quotation from the July 1934 issue of \"Aviation,\" a popular aviation periodical of the day, sums up one writer's impressions of the Senior Albatross:"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"\"Few flying machines have ever exhibited such an extraordinary combination of workmanship, finish, and aerodynamic refinement, so that it seems quite safe to say that the new ships represent the ultimate in soaring design practice in the United States, if not the world.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The pilots who flew the Senior Albatross nearly dominated American competitive soaring.

On June 25, 1934, he flew to within 3.2 km (2 miles) of New York City and established a new world distance record of 254 km (158 miles). On June 30, 1934, du Pont set the U. S. altitude record for sailplanes by climbing to 1,892 m (6,223 ft). The following year, Lewin Barringer soared du Pont’s Albatross II parallel to the ridges of the Allegheny Mountains for 250.3 km (155.5 miles).

On July 8, 1929, East Coast Aircraft, a distributor, bought the aircraft and then sold it to Hugh M. Rockwell of Aircraft Inc. Ronald Ohmeyer purchased it on April 29, 1930 and, in 1932, he had the airplane completely recovered and painted, although there is no record of the color scheme that he used. Ohmeyer kept the airplane until December 1964 when he sold it to J.A. Schlie and W.R. Archer for $1.00 and other unnamed considerations. In July 1967, J.N.

A compass was also installed and it was given the alliterative English registration G-AARO. It first flew in England on August 18, 1980. In May 1981, the original Le Blond 60 engine was replaced with a Le Blond 90 5-DF 90 hp engine, serial number 1061. The airplane made its last flight in England on May 8, 1983 at the Duxford Museum. On May 14, 1983, it sold at a Christie's auction in London to American Charles Osborne who returned the airplane to the United States and re-registered it with its original N9325 number.

The compression strut changes consisted of moving them upward to where the struts attach to the fuselage. Additional instruments were added to the basic instrument group, including a wet compass, fuel gauge, voltmeter, an additional altimeter and an antenna on the turtleback. The Museum removed the compass and antenna (now in storage) to return the aircraft to a more original look. A radio was also installed at some time but was missing when the airplane was received by the museum. The aircraft had 174 hours and 10 minutes recorded time on May 20, 1982, when the airplane was still in England, but no further recorded time can be found. It is located at the Steven F.

In 1952 Piper decided to build the Twin Stinson as a light twin-engine executive airplane. The experimental prototype, the Model 23-1, was a four-place, steel tube-and-fabric, low-wing airplane with a fixed tricycle landing gear and a twin tail. It was powered by two 125 hp Lycoming O-290D engines. Flight tests in 1952 indicated that the airplane was under-powered and had some control response and vibration problems. Correction of these difficulties resulted in the complete redesign of the airplane, including all-metal construction, a single vertical fin, retractable landing gear, and 150 hp Lycoming 0-320-A engines with constant speed propellers. Completed in July 1953, it was renamed the PA-23 Apache and was the first of the Piper \"Indians,\" when Piper began naming its various aircraft after Native American tribes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first production PA-23-4 Apache was delivered early in 1954. Initially the airplane was to have been sold for $25,000 but the actual price at the time of first production was $32,500. This was still the least expensive twin of that class. Much to the surprise of many skeptics, sales began to climb and Piper production capacity had difficulty keeping up with the orders. Apaches came in three versions, Standard, Custom, and Super Custom and ultimately 2,204 Apaches were produced through 1958. Piper upgraded the Apache in 1960 with 250 hp Lycoming engines, new flight instrumentation, a swept vertical fin that increased performance, and a new name, the Aztec. Over 4,800 Aztecs were built. The Apache and Aztec price and size allowed smaller companies and executives to own or operate business aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The PA-23 Apache N114DA was produced in 1954 as the 13th production unit but superstition intervened and it was given serial number 14. Piedmont Aviation, the Piper Regional Dealer located in Winston Salem, North Carolina, initially used it as a demonstrator until William Davenport purchased it in 1956. Davenport planned commuter airline service out of Byrd Field in Richmond, Virginia. Davenport changed the original registration number N1011P to N114DA to reflect the serial number and his Davenport Airlines and painted the aircraft in Davenport colors. Commuter service between Richmond and Hampton Roads was not as profitable as anticipated, so Davenport reorganized as Aviation Specialists Inc. for charter service from Maine to Florida and all points in between and multi-engine flight training. Davenport carried such notable passengers as Virginia Senator Harry F. Byrd, Jr. and movie star Marion Davies. In addition to the charter work, this Apache was a popular twin-engine flight trainer for aspiring corporate and airline pilots."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During its 32-year flight career in Davenport's flight service, the Apache logged over one million miles. It had three complete engine and propeller changes and was upgraded periodically. However, the original instrumentation was reinstalled before its donation to the National Air and Space Museum. With over 25,000 hours of flight time, William Davenport is a notable name in the development of general aviation in the Richmond region and is a member of the Virginia Aviation Hall of Fame. Davenport believed that this was the oldest Apache still flying when he flew it to Dulles Airport on June 20, 1990."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400035764-0","title":"Model, Observatory, UV, Orbiting, Astro-1, 1:20","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e7f03552-87f9-44b5-8745-989fdd3b82d6","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"This is a wooden scale model (1:20) of the Astro-1 observatory designed to fly on Space Shuttle in 1986; the observatory included a Field Camera to observe Comet Halley.

At the time, air transportation in the United States was a trunkline operation, and few feeder lines existed. Acceptance of the Model 18 by foreign and charter lines was immediate, however. The Model 18A, which also operated on interchangeable ski- or float-landing gear, was an ideal adaptation for snowbound areas and for lake and inter-island service. Prairie Airlines of Alberta, Canada, for example, ordered several of these airplanes for use in delivering air mail over a route that extended from Prince Albert to North Battleford, south to Saskatoon and Moose Jaw, finally joining up with the main route of Trans Canada Airlines at Regina. Also, businessmen were favorably impressed with the performance of the Model 18 as an executive transport, with orders coming from Alaska, Canada, and Puerto Rico."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On January 13, 1939, Beech began negotiations with the U.S. government on a contract for a photo reconnaissance version of the 18. Fourteen of these aircraft, designated Type F-2, were ordered as part of the Emergency Procurement Program. This order was followed by a contract for eleven C-45 personnel transports. Later that year, Beech began negotiations with the Chinese government for a bomber trainer. This version had a clear plastic nose, a single gun turret on the upper fuselage, and a machine gun in a tunnel in the rear floor. It also had internal bomb racks, which carried up to twenty 25-pound bombs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"1939 also saw a standard Beech 18S set a new flight record while on a demonstration tour, flying from Bogota to Barranquilla, Colombia, a distance of 450 miles, in 1 hour, 54 minutes. Later the same airplane made a 1,350-mile flight from Maracay, Venezuela, to Miami, Florida, in 6 hours, the first known nonstop flight between those two cities. To further demonstrate the capable performance of the Beech Model 18, Walter Beech entered a D18S in the 1940 Macfadden Race from St. Louis to Miami. With \"Ding\" Rankin as his pilot, Beech crossed the finish line in Miami in 4 hours, 37 minutes to win first place. Their average speed for the flight was 234 mph."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"World War II brought more orders for military versions of the Beech 18S from the United States and foreign governments for a wide range of uses. About 90 percent of the U.S. Air Force's navigators and bombardiers received their training on AT-7s and AT-11s respectively. The U.S. Navy SNB-1 was similar to the AT-11, the SNB-2 to the AT-7. The JRB-1 was a radio-control airplane for target or drone aircraft. The Navy's personnel transports similar to the C-45 were known as JRB2, JRB-3, and JRB-4."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the end of the war came the end of military production, although many of these aircraft remained in service for years. By October 1945 Beech was back into full commercial aircraft production. The first aircraft off the line was the newest model, the D18S, which incorporated a number of improvements. Structural modifications allowed for an increase in maximum weight and new landing gear, brakes, and tires were installed. Two 450-hp Pratt & Whitney Wasp, Jr., engines with Hamilton Standard constant speed propellers powered the D18S. It was the premier executive transport among businessmen and it was also used by the new local service airlines that emerged after the end of World War II."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On December 10, 1953, the prototype of the Super 18, the last version of the Beech 18, made its first flight. The last three production aircraft were delivered in November 1969.

Hogue Produce Company that was already ten years old, but still in good condition. He modified the aircraft as an air ambulance aircraft and operated it at Sky Harbor Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. It could accommodate up to ten ambulatory patients and stretcher patients could be placed on a lounge running fore and aft. Over fifteen years, Mitchell flew his N522B a total of a million and a quarter miles, transporting nearly fifteen thousand patients. He donated it to the Smithsonian in 1976."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023196-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Pressure, German, FL20504-10","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv92a9b5918-34df-4719-8641-40b9e86b4a37","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"55mm dia; World War II; 0 to 10 kg/sq.cm;bakelite case"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023152-0","title":"Tachometer, Mark 7A","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9198e3e0d-ce52-4f7f-81ff-9e0d40abcee4","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"80mm dia; range 0 to 20000rpm; two hands; electric"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400024420-1","title":"Camera, 35mm, Glenn, Friendship 7","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9962326f5-201a-4797-b37c-bb7328a7d619","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"With this camera, an Ansco Autoset model, astronaut John H.

Yankey and Al Mooney, formerly of the Culver Aircraft Company, formed the Mooney Aircraft Company in Wichita, Kansas, in 1946. Mooney's interest in private aircraft reached back to his engineering work at Monocoupe, Bellanca, and Alexander. At Culver, they had built the pre-war Culver Dart and Culver Cadet that became the production PQ-8 and PQ-14 pilotless aircraft and target drones during World War II. The post-war M-18 design was, to some extent, based on many of the successful features of the Culver V and PQ drone airplanes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The M-18 Mite was designed in 1946 and was first test flown on May 17, 1947 by test pilot Bill Taylor. Performance was acceptable but some high angle of attack buffeting was encountered. This was corrected through wing leading edge modifications and the addition of a trailing edge wing root fillet. However, the most severe problem was the modified 25 hp Crosley automobile engine conversion used to power the airplane. With a series of exhaust valve failures and a crank shaft failure during the engine and flight tests, the finall CAA certification was delayed until July 30, 1948. The Crosley powered M18s were subsequently retrofitted with the 65 hp 0-145 Lyncoming engine. This made a major improvement in the overall performance which included an increase in the top speed from 100 mph to 138 mph."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Mite was a well streamlined, enclosed cockpit, single-place, low-wing monoplane, equipped with a manually retractable tricycle landing gear and wing flaps, features that were not available on this class of airplane during that time. The forward fuselage is a welded steel tube structure covered with sheet aluminum panels and the entire rear fuselage is a semi-monocoque wood framework covered with plywood. The cantilever wings are a single spar wood structure with the leading edge box covered with plywood and the remainder of the wing, including the ailerons and flaps, covered with fabric. The retractable landing gear wheel wells are located in the inboard section just aft of the main spar box. The tail section is a plywood-covered wood structure that is itself covered and sealed with fabric. The cockpit is enclosed with a sliding canopy and the airplane can be flown with it in the closed, open, or vent position. The cramped cockpit has a standard stick and rudder pedals with toe brakes. The tricycle landing gear is manually retracted with a lever in the cockpit and the nose wheel is steerable. The erratic flight path of the aircraft during the manual retraction procedure by a first time pilot was frequently a source of much commentary by his peers on the ground."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Pilots in search of a small but quick airplane appreciated the performance and maneuverability. This airplane pioneered the Mooney trademark forward-swept vertical fins that are still an identifying feature on today's Mooney airplanes. It also incorporated a Mooney patented automatic trim system called \"Safe-Trim,\" a moveable horizontal stabilizer that is interconnected to the flaps so that the airplane automatically maintains nose-attitude trim during flap extension (adapted from the Mooney designed \"Simpli-Fly\" system of the post-war Culver V)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"There were a total of 295 M18 Mooney Mites of all models produced, 12 of which were the test prototypes that were later retrofitted to production standards. Production in Wichita, Kansas totaled 203 units before Mooney's move to Kerrville, Texas in 1953. The remaining 92 units were produced at the Texas facility before cessation of Mite production in 1955. The airplane was a victim of the post war glut of light aircraft and its own price escalation problems. Meanwhile, Al Mooney had designed the Mark 20, a four-seat aircraft based on the Mite, but left the company later in 1955. The Mooney Mite Corporation later bought the certification and manufacturing rights to the Mite and sodl the airplane in kit form to homebuilders."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While the records of Mite # 1 from 1947 to 1951 are not clear, an official 1950 Mooney document indicates that a Continental A-65-8 engine replaced the Crosley Cobra and the aircraft was renumbered 201.

In 1951, they added night-flying equipment including a generator, battery, navigation and cockpit lights, instruments, auxiliary fuel tank, and radio equipment. In 1952, the Club installed a Continental C-85-12F engine, upgraded radio and navigation equipment, and painted the aircraft red and white with black trim scheme. In May 1968, the Club reinstalled the 65 hp A-65-8 engine and previous radio and navigation equipment in anticipation of its sale. T.G.

One of these airplanes actually bombed American soil. On September 9, 1942, a Yokosuka E14Y1 GLEN (Allied codename) reconnaissance floatplane launched by catapult from the submarine I-25 and dropped four improvised phosphorus bombs into a forest on the Oregon coast. Five months earlier, the Japanese Navy issued orders to build a new series of submarine aircraft carriers called the I-400 class. Navy planners envisioned a large fleet but eventually only three were completed, I-400 through I-402. The three ships in this class were the largest submarines ever built until the \"USS Lafayette\" sailed in 1962. An I-400 boat displaced 5,970 metric tons (6,560 tons) submerged and it cruised at 18.7 knots surfaced. These ships could travel 60,000 km (43,000 mi) carrying three Seirans in waterproof compartments. A class of smaller Japanese submarines called the AM class was also modified to carry two Seirans."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Soon after commencing the I-400 program, the Navy directed Aichi to develop the Prototype Special Attack Aircraft M6A1. Chief engineer Ozaki confronted an ambitious challenge: develop an aircraft to haul a 250 kg (400 lb) bomb, or an 800 kg (1,288 lb) bomb or torpedo, and fly at least 474 kph (294 mph) with jettisonable floats in place, or 559 kph (347 mph) without floats. The navy also stipulated that assembling and launching the three M6A1s should require no more than 30 minutes. To fit inside a 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) diameter, cylinder-shaped hangar, Ozaki designed the main wing spar to rotate 90° once the deck crew removed the two floats. After rotating the wings, the crew folded them back to lie flat against the fuselage. About 2/3 of the each side of the horizontal stabilizer also folded down, likewise the tip of the vertical stabilizer. Deck crews stored the floats and their support pylons in separate compartments."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Aichi completed the first prototype in October 1943 and started flight tests in November. The second prototype joined the test program in February 1944. The Navy was so pleased with the initial results that it ordered production to start even before Aichi delivered the remaining prototypes, and two land-based M6A1-K Nanzan trainers. However, progress virtually stopped after a major earthquake severely disrupted the production line in December 1944. Boeing B-29 bomber raids further disrupted the project. As the war deteriorated in March 1945, the Navy curtailed the submarine program. The first I-400 was finished on December 30, 1944, and the I-401 followed a week later. But I-402 was converted into a submarine fuel tanker and work ended on I-404 and 405. With the submarine fleet now reduced, the Navy required fewer Seirans so this program was also curtailed. Using parts on hand, Aichi eventually built 26 Seirans (including prototypes) and two Nanzan trainers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Navy leaders organized the 1st Submarine Flotilla and 631st Air Corps and placed Captain Tatsunoke Ariizumi in command of both units. The combined force consisted of the submarine carriers I-400 and I-401, two AM class submarines, the I-13 and I-14, and 10 Seiran bombers. During sea trials, the units practiced hard to reduce the assembly time for the Seiran. Eventually, the crews could launch three aircraft (albeit without floats) in less than 15 minutes! There was a major drawback for without floats, the Seiran pilot could not safely land on the water. His only option was to ditch the bomber near the submarine and await rescue. The aircraft would obviously be lost."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"It was perhaps the most ambitious strategic target selected during World War II. Japanese Navy planners chose to strike the locks of the Panama Canal using the 631st Air Corps embarked aboard the 1st Submarine Flotilla. Planners assigned ten Seirans to strike the Gatun Locks with six torpedoes and four bombs. The pilots studied a large-scale model of the lock system and memorized important features of the canal, just as their predecessors did before attacking Pearl Harbor. During these preparations, the Japanese decided to strike first at the U. S. Navy fleet anchored at Ulithi Atoll. On June 25, 1945, Ariizumi received orders for Operation Hikari. This plan required six Seirans and four Nakajima C6N1 MYRT reconnaissance aircraft (see NASM collection). The I-13 and I-14 would carry two MYRTs each and offload them at Truk Island. The MYRT pilots would take off and scout the American fleet at Ulithi, relaying target information to the Seiran crews. The six Seirans would carry out kamikaze attacks on the most important targets-American aircraft carriers and troop transports."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Trouble dogged the entire operation. The I-13, with two MYRTs aboard, was damaged by air attacks then sunk by a U. S. destroyer.

Quality and workmanship were seriously lacking because of extensive damage to equipment and factories and the lack of skilled, professional workers (many were high school students). A metal flap bore damage-probably the result of a bombing raid-hastily covered with fabric patches. They found the interior of fuel tanks contaminated with paper documents.

Early in 1963, the Grafton Water Ski Club in New South Wales, Australia, asked Dickenson to build a kite for an upcoming water ski festival. Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite. He made and tested models of a Rogallo-type wing and they showed improved stability, but control was little better than the classic ski kite."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Since Lilienthal’s first flights in 1891, pilots had clung to their hang gliders framework and tried to influence the direction of flight by swinging their legs and body to shift their weight in the direction they wanted to go.

Control was feeble at best."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While swinging his daughter sideways on a swing set in 1963, Dickenson had the flash of insight that gave pilots precise control and transformed the hang glider. Dickenson’s idea was brilliant and simple, and added little weight. It consisted of a control bar and a seat or harness suspended from the keel tube by a strap. He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and just behind the control bar, and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips. From the hanging strap, he suspended the pilot’s seat. The strap supported the pilot like a pendulum and allowed him or her to shift their weight with ease, pushing and pulling the control bar to make the glider climb, dive, or turn."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Dickenson tested the controls on a half-size flexible Rogallo-type wing too small to fly. The tests were promising so Dickenson built a kite large enough to lift a person. On September 8, 1963, as John Dickenson looked on, a ski boat towed his friend Rod Fuller aloft for the first flight of a Rogallo-type wing ski kite with the improved Dickenson control system. By 1966, Dickenson was selling his adaptation of the Rogallo-type wing ski kite fitted with his new control system, and in 1967, he introduced fellow Australian Bill Bennett to the booming sport of flying ski-kites. Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name. The excitement of flying and the ease of access to flight provided by the Rogallo wing with Dickenson control appealed to the freewheeling sport leisure culture of the late 1960s, and across America, Bennett's kites grew in popularity."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bennett's early Rogallo designs consisted of two high-strength, heat-treated, anodized aluminum tubes bolted together to form a cross, one a cross bar and the other a keel tube. Two aluminum tubes were bolted to one end of the keel tube to form the two leading edges of a delta wing with a relatively narrow convergence angle of 80 degrees. A Dacron 'sail' attached to this frame completed the semi-rigid airfoil. Pilots sat on a Nylon-webbed seat attached to the keel tube. They controlled the aircraft by grasping a control bar fixed to the keel tube and wired to the wing tips, and shifting their weight side-to-side and fore-and-aft beneath the overhead wing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bennett produced ten different models of the Rogallo hang glider and named each for the length of the keel tube in inches – 162, 174, 186, 198, and 210 inches.

Bennett developed five lighter variations of the tow-kites specifically adapted for foot launching. The Rogallo wings with 80 or 90-degree nose angles became known as standard Rogallos. Soon the modified, or hybrid Rogallo, appeared. These gliders had higher nose angles and longer wingspans. As before, steel wires braced the whole structure to increase strength and improve performance. This version proved much safer than the standard Rogallos, which could be unstable in moderate winds and turbulence. On the early standards, the sails attached to the leading edges and keel tube only, leaving large areas of material loose. All was well if the pilot maintained stable forward flight. The swept leading edges created vortexes that billowed the sail into a stable concave shape. But in turbulence or during a stall, one or both sides of the wing could deflate and collapse, or 'luff,' causing the glider to drop out of control. With more pilots foot-launching off of high rough terrain, hang gliding injuries and fatalities rose, accelerating the transition to modified Rogallo designs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Most hang glider pilots had begun flying modified Rogallos after 1975. Bennett introduced the Phoenix series of hang gliders (see NASM collection) and these and other modified Rogallo gliders allowed pilots to fly farther and more safely.

The Germans claimed that a pilot flew a Do 335 at a speed of 846 km/h (474 mph) in level flight at a time when the official world speed record was 755 km/h (469 mph). Two liquid-cooled engines each developing about 1,750 hp powered the Do 335. Dornier mounted one engine in the nose and the other in the tail in a unique low-drag push-pull configuration. This innovative design also featured an ejection seat, a tail fin which the pilot could jettison, and tricycle landing gear. For a fighter airplane, the Do 335 was enormous: tall enough that a person of normal height could walk beneath it and very heavy at 9,600 kg (21,000 lb) loaded. Serious flaws also plagued the design. The rear engine overheated often and the landing gear was weak and prone to failure."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Claudius Dornier patented the push-pull engine layout in 1937, which was innovative because it offered the power of two engines but less drag and greater maneuverability than other twin-engine configurations. The RLM (German Aviation Ministry) wanted to support development of push-pull aircraft but initially only as seaplanes and bombers. By 1942, the Luftwaffe needed multi-role fighters and after submitting a proposal in January 1943 for a Schnellbomber (fast bomber), Dornier built a prototype Do 335 V-1 (‘V’ for Versuchs or experimental) and the aircraft completed its first flight in September 1943. Following initial testing, the RLM ordered 14 prototypes, ten preproduction aircraft with the suffix designation A-0, eleven production A-1 single-seat aircraft, and 3 A-10 and A-12 two-seat trainers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Dornier selected two Daimler-Benz DB-603 V-12 cylinder engines to propel the four different versions of the Do 335. Each engine displaced 44.5 liters (2,670 cu in) and weighed 910 kg (2,006 lb). Unlike conventional twin-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines, the Do 335 would not yaw sharply to one side if one engine failed, and single-engine flying speed remained respectable at about 620 km/h (345 mph). Pilots reported exceptional flight performance in acceleration and turning radius, and docile handling with no dangerous spin characteristics. In an emergency, however, the pilot could detonate explosive bolts and jettison the pusher three-blade propeller and dorsal fin to increase the chances of successfully bailing out using the pneumatic ejection seat. When fired, the seat pushed the pilot away from the aircraft with a force of about 20 Gs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Dornier finished building as many as 48 Do 335 airplanes and another nine or so were under construction when the war ended. One of many plans issued by the RLM called for Dornier to build 310 Do 335s by late 1945. Although combat conversion units received several pre-production aircraft about 10 months before the war ended, no pilots flew Do 335s in combat. Only one example of the first production version Do 335A-1 rolled off the Dornier assembly line at Friedrichshafen just before the war ended. One 30 mm MK-103 cannon (70 rounds were carried) firing through the propeller hub and two 15 mm MG-151/15 cannon (200 rounds per gun) firing from the top cowling of the forward engine armed this model, and an internal bomb load of 500 kg (1,100 lb) could be carried."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The NASM displays at the Steven F.

If scientists could find any liquid water on Mars, probably only deep beneath the surface, the potential for life to exist was also present."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Mars of today, without any evidence of water whatsoever currently on the surface, probably had water flowing freely in its ancient history. Evidence of changes to the planet’s surface from fast flowing water has been collected by many space probes orbiting the planet since the latter 1990s. The spacecraft to open this possibility was Mars Global Surveyor, reaching the planet in 1998 and a new and exciting era of scientific missions to study the red planet.

When one aircraft is known to be one of the leaders in all three categories, it stands out among others. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II is such an aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Preliminary design of what was to become the Phantom II began in 1953 as a single-place, long-range, attack aircraft designated by McDonnell as the F3H-G (company-financed mock-up). Its predecessors were the FH-l Phantom (the Navy's first jet-powered aircraft to be carrier-based), the F2H Banshee, and the F3H Demon. Working closely with the Navy, McDonnell engineers attempted to design into the F3H-G what it considered to be the Navy's requirements. The result was the AH-l. While there was no military requirement for such an airplane, the Navy did, at this time, explain the desired fleet air mission. McDonnell reconfigured the AM-1 design to meet the Navy's requirements."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The final outcome was designated the F4H-l, the Navy's first Mach 2 carrier-based aircraft, capable of carrying missiles (Sparrows). It could be a one- or two-place aircraft, and its primary mission was as an all-weather fleet air defense aircraft, although it retained its original initial attack capability. The F4H-l made its first flight on May 27, 1958, and later that year it entered into competition with the Chance/Vought F8U-3, then being proposed for the same primary mission. In December McDonnell was awarded a limited production contract for the F4H-l. One year later, the now-designated F-4B Phantom II joined the fleet and was assigned to Fighting Squadron 121. The Navy chose the two-seat version for production. The Phantom was qualified for both land and sea operations, and within a few years several versions were produced for the U.S. Air Force. Production for the USAF of the F-4C was authorized on 8 February 1963."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the period 1959 to 1969, the F4H and its derivatives established many altitude and speed records. The aircraft had been redesignated the F4H-1F and still later in 1962, was assigned new designations as the F-4A, B, G, and J, with the USAF versions being the F-4C, D, and E. Like the F-4B, the F-4C had no built-in gun but carried Sparrow missiles as its primary attack weapon. A reconnaissance version, without armament but using the same basic configurations and engines, was designated the RF-4C. The F-4J was the last fighter version to be placed in quantity production for the US Navy and Marine Corps."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1968 the Navy chose the F-4J for its \"Blue Angels\" flight demonstration team and in 1969 the USAF chose the F-4E for its \"Thunderbird.\" team. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 found its way into the international market with the first delivery overseas to the British in September 1964. Later, Iran, South Korea, Spain, Australia, Israel, Japan, Greece, Turkey, and West Germany bought the F-4. The F-4E was the model preferred by overseas air forces. Specially designed for the Japanese was the F-4EJ that dispensed with most of the offensive systems and was fitted with advanced tail warning radar and air-to-air guided missiles. Japan also ordered the RF-4EJ, an unarmed reconnaissance version. Japan assembled eleven of its F-4s in Japan and built 126 under license. The Germans received the F-4F which had the air-to-ground weapon delivery system removed to save weight. The first truly export model was the F-4K, designed during 1964 for the Royal Navy. This version included the Rolls Royce RB168-25 R Spey 201 turbo-jet engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Production of the Phantom peaked at a rate of more than 70 aircraft a month and by 1979, when production ceased, 5,195 had been built. The last Navy F-4 made its final \"trap\" (carrier landing) aboard the USS America in October 1986.

Early in 1972, VF-31, (with F-4 Bu. No. 157307) went aboard USS Saratoga, and by April en route to the western Pacific for duty in the Vietnam War. On May 18, 1972, the squadron started combat operations on Yankee Station, off the coast of Vietnam. While on a flight on June 21, 1972, its last day on station, F-4 Bu. No. 157307 (Squadron No. 106) made its mark. It was launched that day on a MIGCAP (MiG Combat Air Patrol) with VF-31's Executive Officer, Cdr. S.C. Flynn, USN, as pilot, and Lt. W.H. John as the Radar Intercept Officer (RIO). This was not their regularly assigned airplane. They spotted 3 MiGs and in the ensuing engagement shot down one MiG-21 with a Sidewinder missile (AIM-9).

The start of World War II renewed interest in Germany and Japan in developing this technology. The German Navy looked first at the Arado Ar 231 but this collapsible seaplane proved a failure. It handled poorly on the water and took too long to assemble and disassemble. As the sub's crew put the airplane together on the open deck, the submarine was extremely vulnerable. As a result, the German Navy quickly terminated the Ar 231 program."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By the spring of 1942, the Battle of the Atlantic was beginning to turn against Germany. The U. S. Navy was deploying increasing numbers of anti-submarine assets to protect the eastern seaboard, once a fertile hunting ground for prowling U-boats. The submarine commanders moved their patrols far out to sea to avoid Allied air cover and roaming destroyers. High sea states in these open waters restricted visibility to several kilometers or less, and U-boat commanders were hard-pressed to acquire targets. The expanse of the open ocean also worsened the target detection problem. Near the coast, Allied ships traveled in relatively narrow areas. A U-boat could wait, just beneath the waves in daylight or float on the surface at night, and expect with some certainty that a target would steam within detection range. Away from the coast, U-boats had to patrol much larger areas and this reduced the chances of detecting Allied ships. German sonar and radar technology lagged behind Allied developments and also made detection of the U-boats easier."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The navy asked Focke-Achgelis GmbH to build a rotorkite that a U-boat could tow aloft to search for targets. The aircraft had to fly high enough to substantially boost the scouting range, yet remain small, easy to store, and mechanically simple to maintain and operate. Focke-Achgelis proposed a clever design best characterized by simplicity. The Fa 330 was simple to fabricate, easy to assemble on deck for flight, and weighed so little that two men could comfortably hoist the entire machine. The Fa 330 needed no engine because the submarine towed the gyro kite through the air. Like a gyro plane, the rotorkite flew by autorotation, meaning that the movement of relative wind through the rotors caused them to turn with sufficient speed to generate lift."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The airframe consisted of two 6.35 cm (2.5 in) diameter steel tubes joined to form an inverted 'T.' One tube served as the fuselage of the aircraft, which mounted the pilot's seat and rear control surfaces. The other tube served as the rotor mast. A control stick hung from the blade hub atop the mast. The pilot moved the stick for direct (no intervening control linkage) pitch and roll control, and he used foot pedals to move the large rudder and control yaw. The horizontal stabilizer had no moving control surfaces. Weight was saved on the rotor hub by using steel cables to support the blades against blade droop when the aircraft was not flying. The cables also limited the blades' range of movement when during flight. Instrumentation consisted of an altimeter, airspeed indicator, and tachometer. Its landing gear consisted of two small skids."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The three-bladed rotor turned freely but was limited to 250 rpm. This limit was reached if the aircraft attained a never-exceed speed of 80 kph (50 mph). Normal flight rpm was about 205 at a standard towing airspeed of 40 km/h (25 mph). A minimum speed of 27 kph (17 mph) was required to maintain autorotation. Blade pitch could only be set before flight by turning adjustment screws. The blades used flapping and dragging hinges equipped with variable dampers. The rotor blades consisted of a 3.2 m (10 ft 4 in) steel spar that supported plywood ribs. The blades were 0.3 m (12 in) wide and skinned with fabric-covered plywood. The blade airfoil was almost symmetrical. The blades were precisely balanced during the manufacturing process, which eliminated the need for difficult and time-consuming manual balancing at sea."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Fa-330 was stowed in two tubes of approximately 3.75 meters (12 ft 4in) length built vertically into the U-boat's conning tower. One tube contained the blades and tail and the other contained the fuselage. Four crewmen could assemble the entire structure in three minutes in calm conditions. Rotation of the blades in preparation for flight could be done by hand, but if a course pitch (which provided the best operating performance) was preset on the rotor blades this became extremely difficult. In that case, a rope wrapped around drum on the rotor hub was used to get the rotor turning. The Fa 330 took off from a small platform attached to the aft railing of the U-boat's conning tower. A towline extended from an electric winch to a quick release coupling on the Fa 330. Since the primary duty of the Fa 330 was to spot suitable targets, communication with the towing vessel was essential. The pilot used an interphone system that consisted of a telephone cable, which paralleled the towline. Upon landing a rotor brake was provided to quickly stop the rotor spinning. Disassembly time was not much greater than that required for assembly. If the U-boat came under attack and had to make a crash dive the pilot could pull a quick release lever above the seat, and the towline would separate from the aircraft in addition to releasing the rotor hub from the mast. As the rotors departed they pulled a line out, which deployed a parachute. Once the parachute opened, the pilot released his seat buckle, which allowed the remainder of the aircraft structure to fall away. Additionally, the towline quick release coupling could be manually operated without engaging the rotor release."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By early August 1942, Focke-Achgelis had completed the first prototype Fa 330 and had begun operational testing aboard U 523 in the Baltic Sea with positive results, though it clearly demonstrated that the Type VIIC U-boats were to slow to tow the aircraft successfully. A wind tunnel at Chalais-Meudon, France served as a simulator to train several crewmembers from each vessel that carried a Fa 330. Since very few of the prospective pilots had previous flight experience, and would have little opportunity to practice while on patrol, it was essential that the aircraft be easy to fly. The Fa 330 was stable enough that the pilot could release the stick for seconds at a time without a loss of control."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"At the time the Fa 330 received clearance for deployment at the beginning of 1943, only the Type IX U-boat, with its surface speed of 18 knots, had sufficient speed to ensure the Fa 330 remained airborne in low wind conditions. The Fa 330 used a steel tow cable 300 meters (984 ft) in length, which allowed it to ascend to a maximum altitude of 220 meters (722 ft) when flying at the top speed of 80 km/h (50 mph). At that altitude, spotting distance was 53 kilometers (33 miles) in clear conditions. Like a kite, the maximum altitude attainable was dependent on airspeed. If the airspeed dropped to 50 km/h (31 mph), then the maximum altitude became 200 meters (656 ft) with a possible spotting distance of 50 kilometers (31 miles). If the speed dropped to the minimum safe towing speed of 35 km/h (22 mph) then the maximum altitude was only 100 meters (328 ft), with a possible spotting distance of 35 kilometers (22 miles)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Unfortunately, the Fa 330 possessed a large radar signature and because most of the Atlantic convoys employed numerous escort vessels for anti-submarine duty by the time the Fa 330 entered service, it was impractical to deploy the rotorkite in that ocean. However, in the Indian Ocean, merchantmen still plied the seas without benefit of the convoy system and the Fa 330 could serve the U-boat service to some effect. The U-boat service began committing its longest-range vessels - the Type IX D2, known as the Monsoon boats, to operate with the Fa 330 in the Indian Ocean, frequently operating out of bases borrowed from the Japanese. The first operational deployment of the type occurred in April 1943 aboard U 177, which managed to sink one vessel on August 5 with the aid of the Fa 330."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Operational details of the Fa 330's combat service are almost nonexistent after the U 177 deployment. This is undoubtedly because of the extremely high loss rate among U-boats, which has meant that very few ships' logs have survived. There were several concerns that prevented wider employment of the Fa 330. A U-boat commander was faced with a choice between risking his entire vessel and crew to recover the pilot, or to crash dive the submarine and leave the unfortunate individual to suffer an almost certain death, in the event that the submarine had been spotted, in addition to the fact that it gave away the U-boats primary advantage - stealth. It appears that some U-boat commanders who were not enamored with the Fa 330 took the opportunity to trade them to the Japanese in exchange for floatplanes to patrol around U-boat bases in Java and Malaya. The Japanese Navy enjoyed more success with submarine launched aircraft. They had several classes of large submarines that could carry, launch and recover seaplanes capable of carrying reasonable weapon loads and which would not give away the submarine's position."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although Focke-Achgelis was responsible for the development of the Fa 330, Weser-Flugzeugbau in Hoyenkamp actually produced the aircraft with approximately 200 Fa 330s produced alongside Focke-Achgelis's most significant product - the Fa 223 helicopter, which was the largest rotary wing aircraft of the war. The only notable variation that occurred during Fa 330 production was increase in the span of the rotor blades to 3.79 meters (12 ft 5 in). Later production Fa 330s also had mountings for small wheels to be added to the skids to aid in moving the aircraft on the ground. A version of the Fa 330 was under consideration for surface vessels, which was actually a true helicopter that used a 200 lb, 60 horsepower engine, however this design did not progress much beyond the drawing board."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Fa 330 was viewed with a great deal of interest by the Allies following its discovery on U-852 after it ran aground off the Somali coast during an air attack on May 3, 1944.

It was apparent that such a design allowed a significant increase in visual range at sea for very little effort."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After the war, the United States and Britain conducted extensive tests on the Fa 330 to evaluate this type of aircraft for observation purposes. Captured Fa 330s towed behind boats and even jeeps provided positive results, but the introduction of the helicopter into naval operations rendered such concepts obsolete. A number of these easily stored aircraft appeared on the collector's market, even occasionally showing up in Army-Navy surplus stores and a number survive in museums around the world."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The National Air and Space Museum fully restored its Fa 330 in 1975. It bears the captured aircraft registration number of T2-4618, but it appears likely that the museum's aircraft is actually T2-4616, which was in a display example of captured German technology at Freeman Field in 1946. The Army Air Force then loaned it to Eastern Rotor Craft of Pennsylvania in 1947 for an evaluation after which it into storage for the National Air Museum. T2-4618 conducted a number of flight tests at Wright Field in 1946, during which it was equipped with a wheeled landing gear and towed by a truck. However the relatively large landing gear upset the center-of-gravity and made the aircraft difficult to takeoff and land. After four successful flights the aircraft rolled on landing and sustained some damage. The aircraft was repaired and sent to MacDill Air Force Base for further testing in 1948. There it was towed behind a boat, minus the wheeled undercarriage, for consideration as an aid for U.S. Air Force small rescue boats in spotting downed airmen in the water. Unfortunately in August 1948 the towline broke and the aircraft sank in Tampa Bay, but pilot Capt. Raymond A. Popson managed to escape.

With modifications to its wing length, propeller, avionics, and engine cooling system, it has served as the prototype for subsequent MQ-IL aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As an aerospace milestone, the Predator marked several significant transformations underway at the beginning of the twenty-first century. The first was the dramatic shift from so-called “manned” to Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). This shift had occurred slowly over much of the twentieth century as cruise missiles, target drones, and autopilots narrowed the role of onboard human pilots. The MQ-1 and other RPAS consist of “air vehicles” and ground-control equipment connected to the air vehicle by radio and satellite data links. In most RPAS, including the Predator, humans are essential to their routine operation. While no one flies on the Predator, and it often cruises under control of an autopilot, most of its functions occur at the hands of a pilot, sensor operator, and mission intelligence coordinator in the ground-control station. In this way, the Predator is more “manned” than many other combat aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The second milestone represented by Predator was the ability of its operators to fly it remotely and fire precision weapons in real time from ground stations on the opposite side of the planet. This encouraged development of new strategic doctrines that allowed persistent observation and aerial attack against individual targets with the same weapon system. Previously, the use of separate systems for aerial reconnaissance and for weapons delivery, often involving different military organizations, created operational and bureaucratic delays of hours, and often days, that allowed targets to escape attack or resulted in mistaken targeting. In military parlance, the Predator “closed the sensor-to-shooter cycle” (i.e., the time between the identification of the target and the strike) and “accelerated the kill chain.” The use of the Predator as an “aerial sniper” ushered in a new form of warfare with its own cultural and geopolitical implications."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Third, the Predator’s rise encouraged (but did not cause) a massive upsurge in the use of RPAS by the United States and created an unmanned arms race among other nations seeking similar capabilities. While the MQ-1 was not the most numerous military RPAS of the first decade and a half of the twenty-first century, the nature of its operations gave it a higher public profile than any other and colored the generic term “drone.” The dual nature of the Predator as an observation system and precision-strike aircraft complicated discourse surrounding other so-called drones as they came into greater civil and commercial use."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, ushered in a sustained period of limited war for the United States in Asia and Africa that catapulted the Predator to prominence. The ability of hostile non-state organizations like Al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and the Islamic State to base in nations ostensibly allied, or neutral, to the interests of the United States posed a significant strategic challenge during the War on Terror. Whereas airstrikes, cruise missile strikes, and special operations forces were the primary mode of American operations against terrorist organizations before 2001, they often engendered significant resistance and resentment in local populations and thus were not politically sustainable. Because Predators operated out of sight, were unmanned, and their missiles caused less unintended death and destruction than other means, the MQ-1 and its further development, the MQ-9 Reaper, operated with less political resistance than traditional forms of intervention."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The resulting “drone campaigns” over Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Libya, and Syria have left a complex legacy, with significant claims of success in eliminating terrorist leaders but also considerable concern and resentment arising in much of the world over “collateral damage” resulting in the deaths of bystanders. There has also been a tendency to wrongly assign blame to Predators for strikes carried out by other means, such as by combat aircraft of the sovereign nation where the MQ-1 was used. For some, the Predator represented a cold-hearted disregard for civilians. However, for American policymakers, military commanders, and a majority of the American public, “drone strikes” represented the most efficient and effective means of keeping deadly terrorists at bay—and did so with no risk to American service personnel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Predator had an unconventional and rapid development cycle unusual in modern American military aircraft. The MQ-1’s origins go back to a garage project by Israeli emigrant Abraham Karem. By 1983, he had developed a small long-endurance tactical reconnaissance UAV prototype called the Albatross for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Five years later, further development had resulted in a more advanced design, the Amber, with a superb loitering time due to its high-aspect-ratio sailplane-like wings. A further development, the GNAT 750, resulted in a production-worthy design. Karem’s company and the GNAT 750 were soon acquired by General Atomics."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operated the GNAT 750 in operations over Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1993 and 1994. The program suffered from several technical issues, but it held enough promise that the Department of Defense expressed interest in a larger, more capable enhanced version of the GNAT 750 for medium-altitude tactical reconnaissance, soon designated RQ-1 Predator. By 1995, it too was operating over Bosnia and Herzegovina."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"At the time of the Predator’s introduction, the Navy-helmed UAV Joint Program Office controlled its development, and the Navy and Marine Corps were the only branches with tactical UAVs in regular use. The Air Force soon saw the Predator as an interim replacement for a shortfall in tactical reconnaissance aircraft with the added benefit of a live satellite video link. Authority for Predator development came under the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, nicknamed “Big Safari,” which had responsibility for rapid development of reconnaissance systems outside conventional “mil-spec” airworthiness standards, resulting in a capable, but fragile, aircraft. In the late 1990s, Big Safari expanded the Predator’s capability to include a laser designator to illuminate targets and guide weapons dropped from other aircraft, reducing the sensor-to-shooter cycle. In 1999, this system had its first significant test during Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. One lesson learned was that the sensor-to-shooter cycle was still too great, as sometimes strike aircraft struggled to locate targets spotted by Predator. The solution was to explore options for arming the Predator with its own ordnance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 2000, concern over the rising threat of the Al Qaeda terrorist organization and its leader, Osama bin Laden, encouraged Big Safari to accelerate the schedule for arming the Predator with the AGM-114 Hellfire laser-guided missile, originally developed for antitank helicopters. Given the requirement to make executive-level decisions about priority terrorist targets that might appear only briefly, the ability to watch Predator video and control the aircraft from the other side of the world in real time took on increased urgency. While Big Safari continued development in the United States, it also secretly operated several Predators from a base in Uzbekistan with the CIA during the summer and fall of 2000 to locate Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. This paid off in September, with two and possibly three successful sightings, but President Clinton’s administration had not yet made a decision on direct military action against bin Laden, so the Predators soon returned to the United States. These operations also validated what would become the standard operational profile of the Predator in which a launch-and-recovery team at the operating airfield oversaw the takeoff and landing, but then passed control to a remote ground-control station via satellite, where a different crew managed the mission."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Predator number 3034 demonstrated the first static firing of a Hellfire on January 23, 2001. In February, it began airborne trials of the Hellfire, and in April, with the addition of a new sensor ball and laser targeting system mounted in the nose, number 3034 had evolved into what would become known as the MQ-1—the armed Predator that would become the mainstay of anti-terror UAV operations for more than a decade to come."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Continuing concerns over the legality of targeting an individual like bin Laden with the armed Predator delayed further deployments to Uzbekistan through the summer of 2001. On September 11, just as number 3034 and two other MQ-1s were undergoing final trials before deployment, the worst case Al Qaeda attacks occurred in New York and Washington, D.C."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By October 7, 2001, number 3034 was on nighttime patrol with two Hellfires near Kandahar, Afghanistan, then under control of the Taliban, the state patron of Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. On this sortie, number 3034’s crew successfully located Taliban leader Mullah Omar’s convoy and maintained a firing position and requested clearance to engage. In an incident that has been highly debated ever since, authorization from the US Central Command was delayed and Omar entered a structure. Concerns about potential incidental causalities and damage led to a decision to strike a Taliban security vehicle nearby in a ploy to flush Omar out into the open. This was the first Hellfire strike from a Predator and the first successful operational use of a precision-guided UAV-delivered weapon, though other unmanned aircraft had been employed in offensive operations. During World War II, UAVs loaded with explosives were used as weapons by both the United States and Germany. The U.S. Navy employed the unmanned Interstate TDR-1 using freefall bombs against Japanese targets. At the end of the Vietnam War, the Ryan Model 147 reconnaissance drone was tested extensively with laser-guided missiles and bombs, but never reached operational status."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Predator number 3034 flew one hundred sixty-four operational sorties over Afghanistan between September 2001 and January 2003, with some missions lasting over twenty hours and an average of over fourteen hours. Between August and November 2002, during the middle of its operations from Uzbekistan, number 3034 undertook a detached deployment to another operational site where it flew thirty-two missions. This could have been either Operation Southern Focus over Iraq or deployment to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa to support a CIA surveillance program over Yemen. Given this aircraft’s close association with the CIA/Big Safari program, and the timing of initial operations from Djibouti, the latter scenario is more likely. During its probable time there, a Predator Hellfire strike killed Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, who had masterminded the attack on the destroyer USS Cole. The National Air and Space Museum acquired Predator number 3034 in 2004 on the basis of its pivotal role in introducing armed RPAS into combat."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Given the small number of strikes made by Predators compared to manned aircraft, the impact on doctrine was enormous. The success of the type in locating and killing top enemy leaders made it a favorite weapon of national security advisors and military commanders alike. In April 2001, the US military had only ninety non–target drone UAVs in service, seventy-five of which were small battlefield observation types: the RQ-2 Pioneer and the RQ-7 Shadow. The other fifteen were Predators. Four years later, the number had tripled. Ten years after that, the US military had nearly 11,000 UAVs on inventory. The Predator alone does not account for this profusion, but it unquestionably established the potential of the UAV to shape the battlefield and geopolitics in ways that no aircraft, manned or unmanned, had done before."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Previously, military strikes consisted of fast jet pilots arriving over a chaotic scene with little time to understand the situation, releasing heavy ordnance, and then quickly departing. Accuracy in such engagements could be problematic, particularly with terrorists or insurgents who blended with the local populace. Instead, with the ability to remain airborne for up to forty hours (though operational missions rarely go much beyond twenty hours), Predator pilots and sensor operators could understand the ground situation far more clearly than in any previous aerial platform. The Hellfire missile, while powerful, also has a narrow blast effect, which made possible precision strikes that were impossible from manned aircraft. At a typical operating altitude of 15,000 feet above the terrain, the Predator was silent and invisible to those on the ground (though not stealthy to radar)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This new mode of warfare came with new problems. Because the Predator bypassed the normal procurement process and did not have to meet conventional military standards for ruggedness and reliability it entered operations in something akin to a prototype phase of development. This contributed to an exceptionally high loss rate that reached 28 per 100,000 flight hours (eventually dropping to less than a quarter of that). Another concern was the “soda straw” effect of viewing the world through the tight focus of the camera lens and thus missing important nearby activity. This pushed investments in multiple camera array sensor systems that could monitor larger areas and use computer algorithms to highlight likely areas of concern, such as a vehicle driving in a certain manner or in the appearance of weapon system."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"USAF Predator production ended in 2011 with 268 airframes completed. Additional unarmed airframes were made available to allies, including the United Kingdom and Italy. The Army began development of a refined derivative, the MQ-1C Gray Eagle, which began operations in 2012. Even by the time of Operation Allied Force in 1999, the Air Force was aware that it needed a more capable and refined version of the Predator, so General Atomics began work on the “Predator B,” which entered operations in 2007 as the MQ-9 Reaper and slowly began replacing the Predator. The Reaper has twenty-five percent less endurance the MQ-1 but can carry considerably more ordnance: four Hellfire missiles and two 500-pound bombs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Reaper and Predator are well matched to the nature of the Global War on Terror. For the most part, they have operated against terrorists and insurgents who lack aircraft and air defenses. However, as operations in Iraq, Syria, and Kosovo have shown, they are extremely vulnerable when opposed by a capable enemy, as they are slow and cannot maneuver aggressively. In 2002, the Air Force even adapted a Predator to carry Stinger missiles and attempted an air-to-air engagement with an Iraqi MiG-25—a dogfight that resulted in the loss of the Predator."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The inability of Predator and Reaper to operate in contested airspace with effective enemy air defenses highlights the advances required for RPAS to maintain their operational significance. Jamming poses a significant threat to the Predator’s data links and GPS navigation, so future systems require significant advances in artificial intelligence and inertial navigation as well as faster and stealthier airframes. Another challenge is cultural—who is a pilot? Initially, most RPAS pilots for the US Air Force were experienced combat pilots, but demand soon exceeded supply and the military services began training non-pilot operators. This has created organizational frictions in the military over who has the privileges of pilot status in a world where unmanned and autonomous operations are increasingly important. Regardless, the Predator and subsequent RPAS have dramatically changed the strategy and tactics of limited war in the twenty-first century."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023522-1","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, E-1","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9a29369cc-c5bb-42e6-9778-6562c7f4ed1c","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"3-1/4in.dia.; range 0-300amps; ww2; type e-1"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400027027-0","title":"Mobile Quarantine Facility","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e3a3c887-37fc-4383-b334-15e646e3ed5b","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"This Mobile Quarantine Facility (MQF) was one of four built by NASA for astronauts returning from the Moon.

It was first flown at Issy-les-Moulineaux, a military parade ground-turned-flying-field, on January 23, 1909. Further trials and various modifications proceeded through the spring. By the end of May, the Type XI was fitted with a 25-horsepower, three-cylinder Anzani engine, and throughout the remainder of the spring and summer Blériot was flying with regular success. The Anzani was somewhat crude, but it had a reputation for reliability, which was critical to Blériot's next challenge."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Blériot achieved immortality in the Type XI on July 25, 1909, when he made the first airplane crossing of the English Channel, covering the 40 km (25 mi) between Calais and Dover in 36 minutes, 30 seconds. It was not the longest flight to date either in duration or distance. But the symbolic impact of conquering the Channel by airplane made it the most widely acclaimed flight before Lindbergh. For the effort, Blériot captured the London Daily Mail prize of $2,500 that had been put up by the newspaper the year before for any successful cross-Channel airplane flight. Blériot's original Type XI today is in the possession of the Conservatoire des Arts et Métiers in Paris."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In the afterglow of the Channel flight, Blériot received the first of many orders for copies of his Type XI monoplane. Variants of the original 1909 machine were produced by the Blériot firm, foreign licensees, and enthusiastic amateur builders in Europe and America into World War I. Hundreds were built. Many of the leading aviators of the day flew Blériot aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Blériot XI in the National Air and Space Museum's collection was manufactured by Blériot Aéronautique at Levallois, Perret, France, in 1914. It is a standard Type XI of the immediate prewar period, powered by a 50-horsepower Gnôme rotary engine and featuring wing-warping for lateral control and a castering undercarriage that eased the problem of crosswind landings. The airplane was purchased on July 31, 1914, by the Swiss aviator John Domenjoz, a Blériot company flight instructor. Domenjoz had recently earned a reputation as one of Europe's most celebrated stunt pilots while performing in major European cities during the early summer of 1914. Planning to continue his European exhibition tour, Domenjoz ordered his new airplane to be specially strengthened and added a heavy harness to support the pilot during inverted flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the outbreak of war in Europe, Domenjoz took his new Blériot to South America, where he continued to thrill crowds with daring aerobatics. He would often perform extended inverted flight lasting more than a minute. Flying at Buenos Aires in April 1915, he performed 40 consecutive loops in 28 minutes. Such feats earned him the nickname \"upside-down Domenjoz.\" He returned to the United States in the fall of 1915 and made headlines flying in and around New York City. Domenjoz and his Blériot continued the tour through the American south and midwest late in 1915 and early in 1916. After a stop in Havana, Cuba, he headed north again for another New York engagement."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Domenjoz returned to France in the winter of 1916, serving as a test pilot and flight instructor. In May 1917 he was back in the United States for another exhibition season. Following wartime service as a civilian flight instructor at Park Field in Memphis, Tennessee, Domenjoz made one final barnstorming tour in 1919. He then placed his beloved Blériot in storage on a Long Island farm and returned to France, where he remained for seventeen years."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Some years before Domenjoz came back to the United States to live in 1937, his Blériot had been sold to a museum at Roosevelt Field on Long Island to cover unpaid storage costs. It remained there until 1950 when the Smithsonian Institution purchased it with two other pioneer aircraft and a number of early engines. It was fully restored by the National Air and Space Museum in 1979 for exhibition in the museum's Early Flight gallery."},{"label":"Alternate Name","content":"Blériot XI"},{"label":"Key Accomplishment(s)","content":"First Airplane Crossing of the English Channel"},{"label":"Brief Description","content":"Louis Blériot achieved immortality when he made the first airplane crossing of the English Channel in a Blériot Type XI on July 25, 1909.

Many derided this apparent throwback as a \"tin lizzie.\" It seemed to buck the aeronautical trend toward ever-higher speeds, straight, smooth, all-metal wings, and retractable landing gear. But the Lysander was designed from the ground up to land in, and take off from, places that no one would normally recognize as an airfield. The Lysander could operate comfortably from pastures, fields, and even clearings in the forest. Its survival, the safety of the crews that flew it, and the men and women it carried depended on this performance. The Lysander was used primarily to drop off and pick up secret agents deep in enemy territory."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1935 the Air Ministry issued Specification A.39/34 calling for a two-seat army cooperation aircraft to replace the Hawker Hector. The Royal Air Force manned and led these squadrons but they supported, or cooperated, directly with the British Army. The pilots of army cooperation airplanes performed numerous missions including reconnaissance, artillery spotting, communication, and tactical liaison between Royal Air Force ground attack aircraft squadrons and British Army troops at the front. One of the companies invited to submit a design proposal was Westland Aircraft Limited of Yeovil, Somerset, England. The company was engaged at the time in building the Hector under license from Hawker. Before World War I, Westland had established itself as a maker (under the name Petter) of small oil-burning engines used in agricultural and dairy applications. In 1915 the company approached the government and offered its services for the war effort. With no previous experience, the British Admiralty asked the firm to build airplanes. A tradition began that continues to this day."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Westland's design proposal for Spec A.39/34 was called the P.8. It was mainly the work of Arthur Davenport, under the technical direction of Edward (Teddy) Petter, grandson of the company's founder. According to rumor, an earlier design for a single-engine interceptor was rejected because no one had bothered to ask the Royal Air Force what kind of airplane the service needed. Determined not to repeat the mistake, Petter sought opinions from the Royal Army squadrons that would operate the new aircraft, and he even interviewed his own engineers and pilots. The consensus that emerged favored an airplane with good visibility from the cockpit, the special performance necessary to take-off and land from extremely small areas, and excellent handling at very slow flying speeds."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To see well from the cockpit, Davenport raised the wing to the top of the canopy and braced it with two pairs of sturdy struts. The wing shape was unusual for three reasons. To boost the low-speed characteristics of the airfoil, the wing was thickest at about mid-span but shrank by nearly half at the wing roots. Viewed head-on, the wing bends slightly like the wing of a seagull. The inboard, leading edges tapered toward the tail to allow the pilot to see through the top of the canopy during very steep turns, and the outboard trailing edges tapered forward to give the airplane a snappy roll rate, again to improve maneuvering at slow speeds. To make very slow speed flight possible, the P.8 was the first British service aircraft equipped with trailing edge flaps and leading edge slats. These devices operated automatically and no action by the pilot was required."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Fabric covered the fuselage behind the pilot's cockpit and sheet aluminum covered the nose section. Provisions were made for a flexible .30 cal. machine gun behind the pilot in the observer's cockpit. The distinctive landing gear was the result of some conceptual back and forth between Davenport and Petter. Davenport's original design called for retractable landing gear, but Petter overruled him and insisted on fixed landing gear streamlined with enormous rounded fairings. A landing light and provisions for a machine gun were built into each fairing. The outboard side of each fairing carried fittings and when the need arose, short, stub wings were attached. These held either light bombs, supply containers, or other stores."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In September 1936, after modifications to the horizontal stabilizer, the Air Ministry chose the Westland design and ordered 169 aircraft. It was then the British Army's custom to name cooperation aircraft after classical warriors. Lysander was chosen for the P.8, after a Spartan admiral who defeated the Athenian fleet in 405 BC Westland started production and began delivering finished airplanes in 1938. By the time war broke out in September 1939, seven British Army Lysander squadrons were ready to fly. When the Germans invade France in May 1940, Britain threw as many airplanes as it could spare at the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) including the slow and poorly armed Lysanders. They were decimated. The Lysander excelled in the role for which it was designed but it stood no chance against overwhelming numbers of German fighter aircraft. Lysanders were also not at all suited for ground attack. They were too slow and carried a pitiful load of bombs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After France capitulated, many Lysanders were reassigned to new roles. Some remained army cooperation aircraft, but modified fighter airplanes increasingly flew this mission. As aerial combat moved over the English Channel and British Isles during Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain, a critical need arose for air-sea rescue aircraft. The Lysander could locate airmen downed at sea and drop them life rafts and supplies. Because an amphibious invasion by German forces could come at anytime, a number of modifications for the Lysander were also proposed. Most involved increasing the armament to make the airplane effective at repelling invaders that managed to land on Britain's shores. One proposal sought to add a 20mm canon to each undercarriage leg. Other ideas included adding a ventral gun position (a version nicknamed the \"pregnant perch\"), or turrets behind the wings or near the tail. The tail turret also necessitated a revised stabilizer with two vertical fins and rudders. Late in 1940, the threat of invasion eased and none of these modifications was adopted."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As the war entered its third year, the ultimate Lysander mission began to take shape. The Special Operations Executive formed three squadrons of these slow-flying aircraft, 138, 161 and 357 Special Duties squadrons, and began to fly the Lysander to aid the various resistance movements in occupied Europe. They dropped ammunition, explosives, radios and other equipment and transported agents to and from the continent. Westland equipped the Lysander IIIA (SD) specifically for this role, removing the rear guns and adding a ladder near the rear cockpit so that agents could quickly board or exit the airplane. An external fuel tank was also added to increase range. Many times, Lysanders operated from small, unlit fields. These missions were possible only because the airplane had outstanding STOL (short takeoff and landing) performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Lysanders flew in other theaters of the war, including the Middle and Far East. Turkey, Ireland, Portugal, South Africa, and France flew the aircraft and the United States used 25 Lysanders to two aerial gunnery targets. The Canadians flew more Lysanders than anyone outside England. They also built 225 aircraft and were tooling-up to supply more airframes to ship to England for final assembly when the war ended."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The museum's Lysander was one of the 225 Mk. IIIs built in Canada during 1942. Little is known about its wartime service, but most of the Canadian Lysanders remained in the country to fly as target tugs and communication aircraft. A relatively large number survived in Canada after the war. Some were converted into cropdusters and farmers bought many at auction for their engine parts. Dwight Brooks of Los Angeles searched for two years before locating a Lysander in a farmer's field in Edmonton, Alberta, during the early 1970s. Brooks spent another year restoring the airplane, a job that required finding several other Canadian Lysanders to obtain parts. He received help from the Bristol Engine Division of Rolls Royce when carburetor problems foiled his attempts to run the Bristol Mercury engine. The Royal Air Force Museum provided the paint scheme and markings data for 138 Squadron RAF. During World War II, this squadron was based at RAF Tempsford Airfield. It was controlled by the Special Operations Executive and flew clandestine missions supplying resistance forces and transporting agents to and from occupied Europe."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Brooks flew the restored Lysander at airshows for several years, but in 1977 he decided to donate the aircraft to the National Air & Space Museum.

Numerous disputes between the two quickly arose, however, and Voisin bought out Blériot's interest in the venture in 1906.

Designated the Type L by the Voisin factory, this seminal airplane was an equal-span biplane with no dihedral, with a short nacelle carrying the crew of two in front and an 80-horsepower Le Rhône 9C engine at the rear. A cruciform tail was attached to the wings with a set of booms, and it had a quadricycle landing gear. A second pre-war military design, similar to the Type L, powered by a 70-horsepower Gnome 7A engine, was produced in 1913.

Voisin 3 units staged a retaliatory attack against the Badische Anilin Gesellschaft at Ludwigshaven, Germany, on May 26, 1915, shortly after the German Army introduced poison gas in battle. Successful daytime attacks on targets within Germany ensued, but by 1916 the Voisin 3 and its immediate successors became vulnerable to new, better performing, German fighters. (The Voisin Type 4 was similar to the Type 3, but was fitted with a 47 mm cannon and used primarily for ground strafing. The Types 5 and 6 were virtually the same as the Type 3, except that they had more powerful Salmson engines.) The Voisins were slow and with their pusher configuration they were defenseless from the rear. Despite these limitations, these rugged and reliable aircraft still had a role to play. Voisins were used as trainers and for night missions for the remainder of the war.

But the Hispanso-Suizas were not available in sufficient numbers, and a 220-horsepower Peugeot 8 Aa inline was substituted.

The Type 10, with improved range, speed, and bomb load, replaced the Voisin Type 8 early in 1918. (Only one Type 9 was built.

However, by the time the aircraft were transported to the U.S. and prepared for flight demonstrations, they were already outmoded. On July 12, 1918, Lt. Col. L.S. Horner, of the War Department's Bureau of Aircraft Production, wrote to Smithsonian Institution Secretary, Charles Walcott, regarding \"obsolete airplanes for exhibition purposes,\" offering to the Institution the Voisin, the Caudron, and the Farman. The offer was accepted and the three airplanes were delivered to the museum on September 16 and 17, 1918. The Farman was very incomplete and was deemed unacceptable for exhibition.

Thus, it was the Bellanca C.F.'s fate to be ahead of its time."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In September 1912, Italian immigrant Giuseppe Bellanca founded the Bellanca Aeroplane Company and Flying School in Brooklyn, New York to manufacture aircraft and conduct flight training. Bellanca had built two airplanes in his native Sicily before constructing a Parasol, a small tractor monoplane with a parasol wing, 30 horsepower Anzani engine and a simple open framework with a seat on the lower longeron, in the back of his brother's grocery store in Brooklyn in 1911. He then proceeded to test fly the aircraft, while at the same time, teaching himself how to fly. After the formation of the school and construction of another aircraft, Bellanca began instructing from the ground as students experimented with short hops in the single-seat aircraft.

Fetters to complete the in-progress Bellanca C.F."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Giuseppe Bellanca's C.F. embraced a completely new vision and design in the early 1920s, offering passengers comfort and cover from the weather in a cabin while keeping the tradition of an open cockpit for the pilot. The fuselage had a hump shape, similar to an airfoil that required the pilot, sitting aft of the cabin and off center to the left, to look under the left wing of the aircraft for side and some forward visibility. The struts of the aircraft were also airfoil shape and thus assisted with lift in flight, rather than just supporting the high single wing. Balsa wood, for lightness, formed the leading edge of the two-spar strut. The wooden-frame fuselage was covered with mahogany plywood panels around the cabin and tail area and with fabric on the aft fuselage and on the wings, struts, and flying tail surfaces. The cabin accommodated four passengers and had five small windows on each side. The aircraft was powered by a 95 hp Anzani engine. Harry G. Smith, an airmail pilot, took the C.F. up for its first flight on June 8, 1922, and he reported the aircraft's favorable stability and maneuverability in banking, loops and rolls."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Clearly Bellanca visualized the C.F. as a means of commercial transportation but first he had to introduce the design to the aviation world. Bellanca did so by entering the C.F. in several races with dramatic results. One week after its first flight, the Bellanca C.F. flew at the Midwestern Flying Meet at Monmouth, Illinois, where it won all four events of speed, time to climb, and gliding endurance. Wins at the Tarkio Aero Meet, Interstate Aero Meets, with famed airmail pilot Bill Hobson as pilot, and the National Air Races of 1923, plus two aerial marriages performed in the cabin, garnered publicity for the C.F. and its performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Despite the auspicious start, the C.F. design did not take off. The Yellow Aircab Company of New York purchased the C.F. in 1924, with plans for an aerial taxi service, and added a 110 hp Anzani engine along with a new forward fuselage, a steel-tube landing gear, and more windows in the fuselage. Yellow Aircab went out of business and Continental Aircraft Corporation bought the aircraft in 1925, but it too went bankrupt. P. Bilbertis bought the aircraft on August 30, 1928, and sold it on December 10 to William Stanley Smith for only $150.00. Smith acquired registration number NR11036 for the aircraft, a restricted license because he was a student pilot, and installed first a 35-gallon and then a 55-gallon fuel tank. He also added a vertical stabilizer to the tail. Instructor pilot Paul Kotze was ready to test-fly the aircraft on a marginal day of high winds and low ceilings but veteran pilot Bert Acosta arrived and announced his intention to fly the airplane because it was the one type that he had never flown. Acosta flew above the clouds for awhile and then landed and apologized for commandeering the aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following Smith's death in an accident with another aircraft, the C.F. was displayed and flown at the Roosevelt Field Air Museum on Long Island with a Curtiss D Headless Pusher, the Thomas-Morse S-4C Scout and other early aircraft.

After Giuseppe's death in 1960, the family donated the aircraft to the Museum, and it arrived at the Silver Hill facility in Suitland, Maryland. From January 1979 to May 1980, NASM craftsmen repaired, replaced, or rebuilt significant portions of the aircraft, including the mahogany fuselage, tail section, landing gear, and engine mount and cowling.

He claimed that the Demoiselle 20, designed by Brazilian aeronautical pioneer Alberto Santos Dumont, inspired him to create the Weedhopper. During his teenage years, Chotia took up hang gliding but he soon tired of the numerous inconveniences associated with the sport-finding suitable launch sites, waiting for good weather, etc. He began thinking about designing and building his own powered airplane. Chotia started designing the Weedhopper's wing in high school and he flew the prototype in 1977, a pre-production aircraft the following year, and finally initiated series production of Weedhoppers in 1980."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Weedhopper model C first flew during August 1980. This version was much improved over the earlier A and B models. Chotia died in October 1981, just days before his 35th birthday, while testing another ultralight that he designed called the JC Rocket. Work stopped on the Rocket but continued on the Weedhopper. In 1983, the Weedhopper factory shipped a C model to California and asked graduate aeronautical engineering students at the California State Polytechnic University at Pomona to study the aircraft. After testing a Weedhopper inside the university wind tunnel, the students concluded that the Weedhopper had a very robust airframe that could withstand at least 8 Gs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The group advised the factory to switch to a heavier fabric that would add strength to the wing structure, and to add more ribs to the wing. The firm heeded the student's advice and increased the rib count from nine to eleven. The students also recommended adding a lower surface to the wing and closing the gap in the fabric at the wingroots. Personnel at Weedhopper installed a lower fabric surface that extended from the leading edge back to cover about three-quarters of the wing and they narrowed, but did not completely seal, the wingroot gap. The university team also suggested changing from a rounded wing trailing edge to a sharper profile but this modification would have made the aircraft too fast to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations that governed the maximum level flight speed of ultralight aircraft and the left the trailing edge remained unchanged."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The biggest single improvement to the C model came about when Weedhopper switched from the 25 horsepower Chotia power plant to a Rotax 277 engine that produced 28 horsepower. By 1996, the 40-horsepower Rotax 447 powered this ultralight. Probably because it is one of the first C models, the NASM Weedhopper is fitted with the original Chotia engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Weedhoppers cost less to purchase than other ultralights because the design was very simple. There was no gas gauge. The pilot estimated the fuel level by observing the liquid through the sides of the opaque gas tank. Nosewheel steering was manual and the pilot used his feet to push an aluminum tube that pivoted the wheel left or right. Chotia designed the wing without aileron control surfaces. He used only conventional flight controls (elevator and rudder) on the tail to guide the airplane. Fast aircraft not only cost more to design, they are more expensive to operate. Weedhopper pilots set no speed records as they cruised sedately above the earth at about 43-56 km/h (30-35 mph), but the exhilarating experience of flight also cost them no more than a few dollars. Keeping the Weedhopper simple and slow allowed Chotia to sell the aircraft as a kit, complete with engine, for $4,095 in 1982. In 2002, ultralight pilots could purchase an improved Weedhopper model 40 kit, complete with a Rotax 447 engine, for $7,995. Low purchase and operating costs helped Chotia's original company, Weedhopper of Utah Inc., sell more than 3,000 Weedhopper B models, plus another 2,500 C models. After 1983, Nova-Air and Weedhopper Inc. sold between 3,000 and 4,000 additional JC-24 ultralights. By 2002, dealers had sold nearly 15,000 Weedhoppers world wide."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The NASM JC-24C was the first Weedhopper scrutinized by the staff of \"Ultralight Pilot,\" a magazine published by the Aircraft Owners and Pilot's Association. Three staff members spent 37 hours and used two kits to finish building a single Weedhopper C. Poorly-written instructions and careless manufacture of several parts caused long delays in completing the aircraft. They flew the ultralight airplane for 20 hours before donating it to the Smithsonian Institution. Those hours were full of adventure. Before one test flight, carbon monoxide poisoned the pilot just minutes before takeoff.

To counter this, the German government invited aircraft manufacturers to submit prototype single-seat fighter designs for evaluation at a competition to be held at Adlershof airfield in Berlin in January 1918. The aircraft would be demonstrated by the manufacturers, and would be tested by front-line combat pilots. The design with the best overall performance would be awarded a production contract. Thirty-one airplanes from ten manufacturers were evaluated for such qualities as speed, maneuverability, diving ability, pilot's view, climbing rate, performance at high altitude, etc. One rotary-engined and one in-line-engined design were selected."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The winner in each category was a biplane offered by the Dutch-born aircraft manufacturer, Anthony Fokker. The rotary-engined design was the Fokker V.13, which was produced in small numbers under the military designation Fokker D.VI. Because the hoped-for higher horsepower rotary engines intended for use in the Fokker D.VI were not available soon enough, the airplane had to be fitted with an older, lower-horsepower engine, which rendered performance below combat standards. The Fokker D.VI saw little operational service and was relegated to home defense and training roles."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Far more successful was the in-line-engined winner of the Adlershof competition, the Fokker V.11, which became the Fokker D.VII as a production airplane. The V.11 was largely the creation of Fokker's chief designer, Reinhold Platz. Platz was the true creative force behind the famous Fokker fighters of the second half of the war. He did most of the fundamental design work on the firm's aircraft after 1916. Anthony Fokker's talents were greater as a test pilot than as a designer. He had an innate ability to fly an experimental aircraft and know just what improvements needed to be made to turn it into a successful performer. This intuitive sense on the part of Fokker, combined with Platz's innovative preliminary designs, made them a formidable team. Fokker's ego and dominating personality frequently led him to understate Platz's role as the genuine innovator of the designs that bore the Fokker name, and he took undue credit for himself. Nevertheless, there is no denying the important contributions Fokker made to bringing Platz's designs to final form. This was especially true in the case of the Fokker D.VII."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Fokker D.VII prototype, the V.11, was completed just before the Adlershof competition began on January 21, 1918, so Fokker had little time to test it beforehand. On January 23, famed German ace, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, flew the V.11 at Fokker's request. Richthofen thought the airplane was maneuverable and had generally good performance, but that it was tricky to handle and directionally unstable, especially in a dive. Ritchhofen's assessment confirmed Fokker's own impression of the V.11 from his brief testing of the airplane before the competition began. To remedy these problems, Fokker lengthened the fuselage 40 cm (16 in), added a fixed vertical fin and a new rudder shape, and altered the aileron balances, among other small changes. With these modifications, the V.11 was safe and pleasant to fly, and had lost little of the maneuverability that had initially impressed von Richthofen. The Red Baron flew the improved V.11 and now found the airplane delightful to handle. He urged other pilots at the competition to try it, and they also thought the design was very promising. Given his stature, the endorsement of von Richthofen went far towards the selection of the V.11 as the winner of the competition."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The trials of the V.11 at Adlershof showed Anthony Fokker at his best. His instinctive sense of precisely how to quickly modify the V.11 to transform it from a merely acceptable airplane into a winning design illustrated his genius for incorporating flight test results into design. Moreover, Fokker understood better than any of his competitors that overall performance was more important in a fighter aircraft than exceptional performance in one or two areas, such as speed or climb rate. Other aircraft at Adlershof were better than the V.11 in individual performance parameters. But none surpassed it as a fighter design in the complete sense, regarding not only overall performance but also structural and production concerns."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Upon winning the Adlershof competition, Fokker received a production order for 400 Fokker D.VIIs. Concerned that the Fokker factory would be unable to meet the demand for the new fighter, IdFlieg (Inspektion der fliegertruppen), directed Albatros, (Fokker's great rival) to produce D.VIIs under license. Albatros built the Fokker D.VII at both its Johannisthal and Schneidemühl factories, known as Albatros-Werke G.m.b.H. and Osdeutsche Albatros Werke respectively. The Johannisthal-built aircraft carried the designation Fokker D.VII (Alb) and those constructed at Schneidemühl were identified Fokker D.VII (O.A.W.). Because the Fokker factory produced no construction drawings, working only from jigs and assembly sketches, Albatros had to make its own drawings, based on a completed airframe obtained from Fokker. This, in addition to each firm applying its own construction techniques and standards, resulted in Fokker D.VIIs that looked alike, but differed in detail. Thus, not all components were interchangeable on airplanes built at the three factories. Moreover, the aircraft built by Albatros were generally considered to be of higher quality than those produced by the primary contractor, Fokker. Interestingly, more Fokker D.VIIs were produced by Albatros than by Fokker, with a total for all three factories of approximately 1,000 aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Fokker D.VIIs began to reach front line units in April 1918. Initially, the D.VII was powered by a 160-horsepower Mercedes D.III engine. By the summer, however, the Mercedes-powered D.VII was already having difficulty keeping pace with the latest Allied fighters. The airplane was then experimentally fitted with the new 185-horsepower B.M.W. IIIa, which dramatically improved performance. Unfortunately, only limited quantities of the B.M.W. IIIa were available. The B.M.W.-powered model, known as the D.VIIF, was much sought after by the German pilots, but could only be supplied in small numbers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When the Fokker D.VII appeared on the Western Front, Allied pilots at first underestimated the new fighter because it lacked the sleek, graceful lines of the German Albatros fighters. But they soon revised their view, despite the comparatively ungainly appearance of the D.VII. One reason for this was the soon-to-be-famous ability of the Fokker D.VII to seemingly \"hang on its propeller,\" and fire into the unprotected underside of Allied two-seater reconnaissance aircraft. The Fokker D.VII's thick wing section endowed the airplane with good stall characteristics. Positioning below and behind a two-seater, where the enemy observer could not bring his guns to bear, a D.VII pilot could safely put his airplane into a nose-high attitude, with full power, in a nearly stalled condition. The capability of the D.VII to perform this maneuver made it a highly feared opponent in combat."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Many experimental variants of the Fokker D.VII were developed during the remaining months of the war, mostly employing different engine installations. But none reached production status. A two-seat version was designated the Fokker C.I, but it was never officially adopted by the German Air Service.

The pilot and airplane were captured by three American officers before Beaulieu-Marconnay could set fire to his aircraft. It is uncertain whether or not Beaulieu-Marconnay was lost and mistakenly landed at what he thought was a German airfield (as he claimed), or simply surrendered, knowing that the war would soon be over and fabricated the story. The Fokker D.VII was brought to the United States after the war and given to the Smithsonian Institution by the War Department in 1920. The airplane was fully restored by NASM in 1961.

The kits cost one-fifth the $2,500 asking price of the higher performance Bowlus-du Pont Senior Albatross (see NASM collection).

His approach would get more pilots flying more frequently and perhaps bring in new blood to the small community of soaring pilots at a time when the movement was trying to survive the depths of the Depression. Thus was born the Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross, named because the dimensions and layout of the wing resemble that of the Grunau Baby designed in Germany, and because Hawley's astute business sense told him that a 'Baby' version of his Senior Albatross had valuable built-in name recognition."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The earliest known drawing of a Baby Albatross dates to February 1936, therefore Bowlus had probably begun to think about the design in 1935. The designer must have considered the special needs of amateur builders from the beginning. By adopting a simple and inexpensive aluminum tube to connect the cockpit pod and the empennage, he saved the builder considerable time fabricating and assembling a more conventional fuselage built up from many wooden or metal parts. Bowlus designed the wooden pod that enclosed and streamlined the cockpit in such a way that he and several crafts persons could prepare the parts and mail them to builders for final assembly."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In September 1936, with the help of Don S. Mitchell, Bowlus began building the first of four Baby Albatross prototypes in a lean-to adjoining his backyard shop in San Fernando, California. Years later, Mitchell designed an interesting series of all-wing ultralights including the Mitchell U-2 Superwing (see NASM collection). Bowlus and Mitchell stated working early in February 1937 and completed the aircraft one year later. While Mitchell worked almost around-the-clock for several months, Bowlus could spare only nights and weekends as he struggled to support his wife, Ruth, and their four children. The first prototype differs from the later versions in some important ways: Bowlus used cables for aileron control rather than heavier, but more precise, push rods. He also skinned the ailerons with plywood but chose not to rig them to move differentially to minimize adverse yaw. The elevators are the same type fitted to the Senior Albatross. According to one account, the first prototype Baby Albatross, registered NX18979, is fitted with the aluminum nose cap from the Senior Albatross number 3, registered G13780."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hawley Bowlus would sell to those that could afford it a factory-built and ready-to-fly Baby Albatross for $750.00 in 1938, minus instruments and cockpit cover.

They carried such critical tasks as the precise alignment of parts requiring the time-consuming construction of jigs to hold the pieces in position during assembly. Builders assembled the major components and finished the sailplane by applying fabric, varnish, and paint. Bowlus left easily fabricated parts such as the canopy and windshield for builders to design and form, based on the type of flying they planned to do. The designer did not equip the Baby with spoilers to improve glide path control but a number of owners installed them later. The omission was significant in a glider aimed at a large public market composed of pilots of varying skill levels, but Bowlus deemed the tradeoff worthwhile as it made the wing considerably easier to build."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To further simplify and speed construction, Bowlus used an aluminum tube to join the fuselage pod with the empennage. It may look like irrigation pipe, but it was actually an extrusion manufactured by Alcoa from 17ST aluminum alloy. The designer used the extrusion on the first 65 Baby Albatross aircraft but thereafter, he adopted a boom rolled from 2024-T3 aluminum sheet and riveted at the seam by workers in the Douglas plant in Santa Monica, California. The pod-and-boom fuselage set the Baby Albatross apart from other sailplanes of the late 1930s but the aircraft was unique in other ways, too."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bowlus shaped the complex curves on the fuselage pods of the four prototypes by gluing, screwing, and nailing small pieces of 'scarf-jointed' plywood onto a plywood frame. The scarf joint refers to the careful and time-consuming method of shaping the plywood edges to meet at precise angles with no gaps. Wood workers had to shape each piece differently to fit the continuously curved surface of the pod. Precision was important to give the weak casein glue as much surface as possible with to bond. To manufacturer pods for the kits, Bowlus abandoned the laborious scarf-jointed pod and adopted a technique similar to that used by Lockheed to build fuselages for the Vega, Orion, and Altair monoplanes flown by Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, Roscoe Turner, Charles Lindbergh, and other record-setting flyers during the 1920s and 1930s. Crafts persons layered .07 cm (1/32 inch) mahogany and poplar plywood veneer into a wooden mold with glue sandwiched between the layers. They then placed an inflatable bag over the wet layers, and lowered a concrete male mold down into the wooden mold and bolted it securely a few inches above the bag. The crafts persons inflated the bag so that it evenly applied about (10 lb/in²) to the whole inside of the pod skin, and set aside the mold aside to dry. After waiting several days, they removed the finished halves, trimmed and dressed them, and glued and nailed the shells to the internal framework. A molded pod sped construction because it required only six frames versus eleven for the scarf-jointed pods used for the prototypes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The cockpit was too narrow to accommodate a conventional, three-axis, control stick. To permit the pilot to roll the sailplane, Bowlus copied the arrangement he had used in the Senior Albatross and mounted a smart-looking 'butterfly' wheel on top of a stick. By pushing a set of conventional rudder pedals, the pilot controlled yaw, and a simple panel presented the essential instruments: altitude, airspeed, and compass. A competent pilot could fly the Baby Albatross at a maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 19:1 at 56 km/h (35 mph). Bowlus set the never-exceed speed, at 100 km/h (62 mph). The Baby Albatross was capable of doing well in soaring contests in the hands of experienced pilots. Unfortunately, the design of the elevator control made the aircraft sensitive about the pitch axis, something that new pilots had to approach with great care. Operating the aircraft for several years revealed that that neither the streamlined wooden shell around the cockpit, nor the aluminum castings used for fittings in areas subjected to high stress, were durable enough. Despite these shortcomings, the design became the most successful aircraft that Bowlus developed. Such respected names in the aviation industry as Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, Rubin Fleet at Consolidated Aircraft, engine builder Al Menasco, Glenn L. Martin, Jack Northrop, and Donald Douglas backed the production of the kits and kept the cost down to less than one-third the price of a Senior Albatross. Hawley Bowlus might have sold many hundreds had World War II not intervened."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Factory records suggest that Bowlus produced parts for about 90 aircraft. Pilot and historian, Jeff Byard, has attempted to trace the histories of each known Baby Albatross serial number. His work has shown that enthusiasts probably built and flew from 50 to 60. Among the group were pilots who accomplished significant flights at the controls of their Baby Albatrosses. Eastern Airlines Captain J. Shelly Charles of Atlanta made a number of impressive flights. He flew 423 km (263 miles) on one occasion and later soared to an altitude of more than 3,040 m (10,000 ft). On 6 June 1939, Woody Brown flew his Baby Albatross, \"Thunder Bird,\" a distance of 451 km (280 miles) from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Wichita, Kansas, a U. S. National record for distance flown to a declared goal. Dick Johnson's first win at the U. S. nationals came in 1940 at the controls of a Baby Albatross. According to Bowlus records, Florence \"Pancho Barnes\" Lowe, bought serial number 118 and kit units 1, 2, 3, and 4 were shipped to her by 15 December 1939, but no further information is known. After World War II, a saloon owned by Lowe at Muroc, California, called the Happy Bottom Riding Club, became a favorite meeting place for test pilots such as Scott Crossfield and Chuck Yeager."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Only 17 Baby Albatross aircraft survived in 2006. The Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum owns the first prototype, serial number 101. Hawley Bowlus began building this sailplane in September 1936 and with considerable help from Don Mitchell, who joined him in February 1937, they finished the ship in February 1938. The regulating authorities assigned the registration NX18979 and Bowlus and Mitchell flew it at Arvin, California, in March. There are gaps in the airplane's history, however it is known that Mitchell clocked 273 hours while flying it. He and the sailplane were towed aloft by almost every conceivable means: automobile, airplane (40-hp Piper Cub), pulley, winch, and bungee-launch. On one memorable occasion, as eager listeners monitored his live broadcast from the cockpit, horses ridden by the Hollywood celebrities Edgar Bergan, Andy Devine, and Don Wilson, towed Mitchell and the sailplane into the air at the Grand Central Airport in Glendale, California. NBC radio carried the performance live. Mitchell and the competition pilot, Jack O'Meara, took the aircraft to the 1938 U. S. National Glider Contest held at Harris Hill in Elmira, New York. O'Meara placed fourth in the contest standings."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Frank Kelsey, president of Salt Lake City Glider Club, visited Bowlus early the following year and flew 6 flights in the NX18979 at Muroc Dry Lake. That August, U. S. Navy Lt. Horace E. Tennes purchased the sailplane and the following month, Ed W. Hudlow, Aeronautical Inspector, Civil Aeronautics Administration, issued an Airplane Tow Permit to Tennes to tow the sailplane behind a powered aircraft. During the spring of 1940, the Navy assigned Tennes to Fighter Squadron VF-6 based at Naval Air Station Coronado, California. From March 8-18, Bowlus Sailplanes Inc. carried out the following work on NX18979: \"Recover Baby Albatross 100, wings, struts, elevators. Install instrument in instrument board. Check ship thoroughly.\" On 8 July 1941, authorities authorized Tennes to conduct \"experimental testing within the 6th CAA Region.\" At the time, Tennes was stationed at Naval Air Station San Diego, California the details about these experiments remain unknown. Later that year, a startling development occurred when Tennes loaded his Baby Albatross aboard the aircraft carrier Enterprise and sailed with the sailplane to Hawaii. Whether Tennes or anyone else flew NX18979 while overseas remains a mystery but the naval officer went on to command fighter squadron VF-86, nicknamed the Wild Hares, from June 1944 to January 12, 1945, and fighter-bomber squadron VBF-86, nicknamed the Vapor Trails, until the unit disestablished on November 21, 1945."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Tennes may have simply stored the Baby Albatross until after the war.

Hed and Whitmore enjoyed some great flying adventures before selling the aircraft to B. A. Wiplinger of St. Paul, Minnesota, on 16 December 1954, according to the bill of sale.

Trippe had been spending much of his time searching for a suitable jet airliner to enable his pioneering company to maintain its leadership in international air travel. Working with Boeing, Trippe overcame Boeing's resistance to widening the Dash-80 design, now known as the 707, to seat six passengers in each seat row rather than five. Trippe did so by placing an order with Boeing for 20 707s but also ordering 25 of Douglas's competing DC-8, which had yet to fly but could accommodate six-abreast seating. At Pan Am's insistence, the 707 was made four inches wider than the Dash 80 so that it could carry 160 passengers six-abreast. The wider fuselage developed for the 707 became the standard design for all of Boeing's subsequent narrow-body airliners."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Although the British de Havilland D.H. 106 Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 entered service earlier, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were bigger, faster, had greater range, and were more profitable to fly.

National Airlines inaugurated domestic jet service two months later using a 707-120 borrowed from Pan Am. American Airlines flew the first domestic 707 jet service with its own aircraft in January 1959. American set a new speed mark when it opened the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental jet service in 1959. Subsequent nonstop flights between New York and San Francisco took only 5 hours - 3 hours less than by the piston-engine DC-7. The one-way fare, including a $10 surcharge for jet service, was $115.50, or $231 round trip.

At one point, the Dash 80 carried three different engine types in its four nacelles. Serving as a test bed for the new 727, the Dash 80 was briefly equipped with a fifth engine mounted on the rear fuselage. Engineers also modified the wing in planform and contour to study the effects of different airfoil shapes. Numerous flap configurations were also fitted including a highly sophisticated system of \"blown\" flaps which redirected engine exhaust over the flaps to increase lift at low speeds.

As Boeing had done with the B-17, it risked the company on one roll of the dice and won."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Boeing engineers had initially based the jet transport on studies of improved designs of the Model 367, better known to the public as the C-97 piston-engined transport and aerial tanker. By the time Boeing progressed to the 80th iteration, the design bore no resemblance to the C-97 but, for security reasons, Boeing decided to let the jet project be known as the 367-80."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Work proceeded quickly after the formal start of the project on May 20, 1952. The 367-80 mated a large cabin based on the dimensions of the C-97 with the 35-degree swept-wing design based on the wings of the B-47 and B-52 but considerably stiffer and incorporating a pronounced dihedral. The wings were mounted low on the fuselage and incorporated high-speed and low-speed ailerons as well as a sophisticated flap and spoiler system. Four Pratt & Whitney JT3 turbojet engines, each producing 10,000 pounds of thrust, were mounted on struts beneath the wings."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Upon the Dash 80's first flight on July 15, 1954, (the 34th anniversary of the founding of the Boeing Company) Boeing clearly had a winner. Flying 100 miles per hour faster than the de Havilland Comet and significantly larger, the new Boeing had a maximum range of more than 3,500 miles. As hoped, the Air Force bought 29 examples of the design as a tanker/transport after they convinced Boeing to widen the design by 12 inches. Satisfied, the Air Force designated it the KC-135A. A total of 732 KC-135s were built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Quickly Boeing turned its attention to selling the airline industry on this new jet transport. Clearly the industry was impressed with the capabilities of the prototype 707 but never more so than at the Gold Cup hydroplane races held on Lake Washington in Seattle, in August 1955. During the festivities surrounding this event, Boeing had gathered many airline representatives to enjoy the competition and witness a fly past of the new Dash 80. To the audience's intense delight and Boeing's profound shock, test pilot Alvin \"Tex\" Johnston barrel-rolled the Dash 80 over the lake in full view of thousands of astonished spectators. Johnston vividly displayed the superior strength and performance of this new jet, readily convincing the airline industry to buy this new airliner."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In searching for a market, Boeing found a ready customer in Pan American Airway's president Juan Trippe. Trippe had been spending much of his time searching for a suitable jet airliner to enable his pioneering company to maintain its leadership in international air travel. Working with Boeing, Trippe overcame Boeing's resistance to widening the Dash-80 design, now known as the 707, to seat six passengers in each seat row rather than five. Trippe did so by placing an order with Boeing for 20 707s but also ordering 25 of Douglas's competing DC-8, which had yet to fly but could accommodate six-abreast seating. At Pan Am's insistence, the 707 was made four inches wider than the Dash 80 so that it could carry 160 passengers six-abreast. The wider fuselage developed for the 707 became the standard design for all of Boeing's subsequent narrow-body airliners."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although the British de Havilland D.H. 106 Comet and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-104 entered service earlier, the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 were bigger, faster, had greater range, and were more profitable to fly. In October 1958 Pan American ushered the jet age into the United States when it opened international service with the Boeing 707 in October 1958. National Airlines inaugurated domestic jet service two months later using a 707-120 borrowed from Pan Am. American Airlines flew the first domestic 707 jet service with its own aircraft in January 1959. American set a new speed mark when it opened the first regularly-scheduled transcontinental jet service in 1959. Subsequent nonstop flights between New York and San Francisco took only 5 hours - 3 hours less than by the piston-engine DC-7. The one-way fare, including a $10 surcharge for jet service, was $115.50, or $231 round trip. The flight was almost 40 percent faster and almost 25 percent cheaper than flying by piston-engine airliners. The consequent surge of traffic demand was substantial."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The 707 was originally designed for transcontinental or one-stop transatlantic range. But modified with extra fuel tanks and more efficient turbofan engines, the 707-300 Intercontinental series aircraft could fly nonstop across the Atlantic with full payload under any conditions. Boeing built 855 707s, of which 725 were bought by airlines worldwide."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Having launched the Boeing Company into the commercial jet age, the Dash 80 soldiered on as a highly successful experimental aircraft. Until its retirement in 1972, the Dash 80 tested numerous advanced systems, many of which were incorporated into later generations of jet transports. At one point, the Dash 80 carried three different engine types in its four nacelles. Serving as a test bed for the new 727, the Dash 80 was briefly equipped with a fifth engine mounted on the rear fuselage. Engineers also modified the wing in planform and contour to study the effects of different airfoil shapes. Numerous flap configurations were also fitted including a highly sophisticated system of \"blown\" flaps which redirected engine exhaust over the flaps to increase lift at low speeds. Fin height and horizontal stabilizer width was later increased and at one point, a special multiple wheel low pressure landing gear was fitted to test the feasibility of operating future heavy military transports from unprepared landing fields."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After a long and distinguished career, the Boeing 367-80 was finally retired and donated to the Smithsonian in 1972."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023390-1","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, E-1","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9f977f092-7db2-40bd-9094-062a687ca59e","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"3-1/4in.dia.; range 0-300amps; WW2; type e-1; pos.& neg.poles"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022246-1","title":"Model, Static, Laird LC-DW Solution","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e4a62b71-d6a2-4b30-88a1-6c542406ceba","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Balsa and metal display model of the Laird LC-DW Solution racing aircraft which won the 1930 thomson Trophy race in black and natural, uncovered structure paint scheme. 1/16 scale."},{"label":"Summary","content":"The real Laird Solution won the 1930 Thompson Trophy Race."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023124-0","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, B-1","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9a8fef06d-977e-4a81-a083-cc05b659a050","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"82mm diam, 33mm depth; 3-1/4 o/a dia."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023488-1","title":"Transmitter, Trim Tab Position, German","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv97922c123-4c93-479e-949f-d84988af4253","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"52mm dia;52mm l;3-prong electrical connector,ww2"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400035789-1","title":"Indicator, Hydraulic Pressure, Japanese Navy, Model-2","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9746a3e0e-3668-4286-be5b-1f8c579aeec2","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"2 1/4in. diameter, 1 1/4in. deep; 1 connection on back; range 0 - 150; navy; j2m3, b5n2."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022253-0","title":"Bell XP-59A Airacomet","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e678c278-101a-425c-b6bd-85a389125522","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"All-metal, single-seat, two engine monoplane with shoulder-mounted wing."},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Wing Span 1,490 cm (586 in.), Length 1,180 cm (465 in.), Height 380 cm ( 150 in. ), Weight 3,320 kg (7,319 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"The XP-59A is the first American jet aircraft.

S. propulsion engineers were seriously considering the possible applications of jet turbine engines to the airplane. War accelerated efforts to design and fly jet aircraft. On February 25, 1941, General Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold, Deputy Chief of Staff for Air (later commanding general of the AAF), wrote to Dr. Vannevar Bush, chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), asking him to form a special group to consider jet aircraft propulsion. Bush complied the following month and the \"Special Committee on Jet Propulsion\" included representatives from the Army Air Corps, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, National Bureau of Standards, Johns Hopkins University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the three U. S. manufacturers of various industrial turbines and turbo-superchargers for reciprocating aircraft engines, Allis Chalmers, Westinghouse, and General Electric."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In April 1941, Arnold was briefed on the Gloster E.28/39 jet-propelled test airplane and he watched the airplane fly in England. A W.1X turbojet engine designed by Frank Whittle powered the E.28/39. Arnold returned to the U. S. in May and briefed members of the AAF Engineering Division at Wright Field, Ohio, and the U. S. State Department. Efforts began to exchange information on this technology and on July 22, 1941, British and American officials met to discuss it. On September 4, officials of the U. S. government, the Army Air Forces, and the General Electric company met and decided that the United States must begin at once to construct 15 jet turbine aircraft engines (copies of a new Whittle engine, the W.2B) and three jet airplanes. The Whittle engine was not overly powerful so the group chose a twin-engine configuration for the new jet. General Electric was selected to build the engines because the firm was already familiar with the Gloster aircraft and the Whittle engine. Several factors influenced the group's decision to select the Bell Aircraft Corporation to build the new fighter."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"At that time, Bell was not as busy developing and producing aircraft as other manufacturers. Their location near the General Electric plant was thought a boon to the vital exchange of information between airframe and engine developers. The group also considered Larry Bell's enthusiasm and reputation for making unorthodox designs fly. On September 5, Arnold informed Bell that his company would undertake the new project. A contract was awarded on September 30. AAF leaders and Bell officials chose the designation XP-59A as a good cover for the true nature of this work because the designation originally referred to a piston engine fighter project proposed earlier by Bell. General Electric used a similar ruse. At that time, the company built aircraft engine superchargers with model designations 'A' through 'F.' 'I' seemed to fit this pattern. 'A' signified the first of a series so General Electric and the AAF designated the first American jet airplane engine the Type I-A."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During September 1941, Larry Bell and his Chief Engineer, Harland M. Poyer, assembled a team and began to design the first American jet airplane. The team was guided only by theory. General Electric would not finish and begin testing the first engine until March 1942 so Bell could only guess at the performance characteristics. In fact, neither the W.1X engine shipped from England in October 1941 nor General Electric's own versions could generate the power levels initially predicted. Extreme secrecy and great urgency also hampered the project. For security reasons and to get the airplane flying as quickly as possible, General Arnold had at first forbidden use of wind tunnels to test and optimize the design. Later he relented but only allowed the group to use the low-speed tunnel at Wright Field, Ohio."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On September 19, Bell shipped the first XP-59A to a remote base in California, Muroc Dry Lake, for the initial flight trials. To maintain secrecy, Bell mounted a dummy propeller on the nose and threw a tarpaulin over the fuselage to disguise the Airacomet as just another new piston engine aircraft. Mechanics removed the \"propeller\" before flight and reinstalled it after the airplane landed. On October 1, 1942, Bell test pilot Robert M. Stanley took the XP-59A into the air for the first time. During this initial flight, Stanley kept the landing gear fully extended and flew no higher than 7.6 m (25 ft). Later that day, he made three more flights and reached heights of 30 m (100 ft). The flight envelope expanded further the next day after four more flights at altitudes as high as 3,048 m (10,000 ft)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Two General Electric Type I-A centrifugal-flow jet engines drove the unrefined XP-59A airframe to a maximum speed of only 628 kph (390 mph). A number of enemy and Allied piston engine fighters exceeded this velocity so in March 1942, the Bell Company received a follow-on contract for 13 YP-59A test and evaluation aircraft. More powerful General Electric I-16 (J31) turbojet engines powered these and all subsequent production Airacomets. The first of 13 YP-59As arrived for flight-testing at Muroc in June 1943. One of these aircraft set a new unofficial altitude record of 14,512 m (47,600 ft). Although Bell proposed that the Army Air Forces should acquire 300 P-59 production fighter aircraft, the Army decided to order only 100. Despite the altitude record, the P-59 was clearly outclassed by contemporary piston engine fighters such as the North American P-51 Mustang, Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, and Lockheed P-38 Lightning (see NASM collection for these aircraft)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Eventually, Bell completed only 50 production Airacomets-20 P-59As and 30 P-59Bs. Each was armed with one 37-mm M-4 cannon and 44 rounds of ammunition, and three .50 cal. machine guns and 200 rounds per gun. The P-59Bs were assigned to the 412th Fighter Group to familiarize AAF pilots with the handling and performance characteristics of jet aircraft.

Rather than the larger pre-war biplanes, Pitts wanted something smaller that would climb, roll, and change attitude much more quickly. Instead of a large radial engine, Pitts built his aircraft around the new smaller and lighter horizontally-opposed engines. The swept wing allowed for access and center of gravity (CG) factors and made snap rolls snap more sharply.

The venerable war surplus WWI Curtiss JN-4D Jenny was put into service, but it soon became apparent that a more \"purpose designed\" crop duster was needed. The Huff-Daland Manufacturing Company of Ogdensburg, New York modified its Petrel 5 military/commercial biplane into a practical duster with a chemical tank and spreader system and formed the Huff-Daland Duster Company in Louisiana. C.E. Woolman soon took over the faltering company and with entomologist Dr. Bert Coad built a pioneering insect and chemical research and aerial delivery business throughout the country. Woolman also expanded the business to include passenger and freight carrying and renamed it Delta Air Service, which became Delta Airlines. With the deep Depression years of the 1930s and then World War II, further development of crop duster airplanes was shelved until after the war. Delta Airlines later restored one of the only two remaining original Huff-Daland Dusters and donated it to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum in 1968; it now hangs at the Steven F.

The Stearman was a good airplane; however, it and other civil aircraft such as the DC-6 and Antonov AN-2M were never designed for sustained flying in this type of environment. Crop dusting is flying swaths of fields at extremely low altitude (8-10 feet), performing procedural turns at low altitude, and climbing and diving expediently for position and to avoid wires and trees. The field of flight must be exact to ensure precise, even application and contain drift of the load only onto the field and not onto homes or roads. Power management, maneuverability, and changing weight and balance combined with wind drift and specific application characteristics of the load add to the ever-changing equation for the pilot. Consequently a number of airplane companies began to consider an airplane design to meet these specific requirements."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1955, Grumman preliminary design engineers Joe Lippert and Arthur Koch proposed the design for a \"purpose built\" crop dusting airplane as a means of fulfilling a pressing need by the agricultural community as well as the perceived need for Grumman to diversify its product lines. A major consideration for their rugged and maneuverable biplane duster concept was the availability of thousands of inexpensive war surplus 220 horsepower Continental radial engines. The aircraft structure would have to be very strong to accommodate the large hopper, payload, and accompanying spray/spreader equipment and sustain safe flight. For expediency, prototype construction began at Lippert's home as Roy Grumman approved their plan for experimental test prototypes in 1956 and also provided a hanger and a limited number of personnel and funding for building and testing at Bethpage, Long Island."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Ag-Cat's first flight, made on May 27, 1957, went exceedingly well with the second prototype following one month later. Three senior crop dusting pilots were brought in from various parts of the country to test the airplane and, in the summer of 1958, an extended east coast demonstration tour allowed well over 100 duster pilots to put the two prototypes through their paces. The pilots were delighted with its handling qualities and its low stall speed of 67 mph as stalling an aircraft, i.e. loss of lift, while entering a turn at low speed and low altitude was a major crop duster pitfall. Pilots were also impressed with the cockpit that offered good visibility and was designed to withstand a 40 g impact. One of the pilots, Dick Reade, suggested the name \"Ag-Cat\" in keeping with Grumman's practice of using the word \"cat\" in its military aircraft nomenclature, i.e. Hellcat; Reade's name is painted on this NASM aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Upon their return to Bethpage, Lippert and his team found that an upsurge of Grumman military orders were going to prevent the production of the Ag-Cat at the Long Island factory, however, the Board of Directors subcontracted the entire program to the Schweizer Aircraft Company of Elmira, New York. The first Schweizer-built Ag-Cat flew in 1959. The Ag-Cat is a single-seat, strut-braced biplane with a 35 percent wing stagger which provides the excellent low speed wing stall characteristics that are necessary for low altitude maneuvers. The fuselage is constructed of a welded steel tubing truss which is covered with removable aluminum panels to facilitate post flight cleaning. The pilot's safety reinforced open cockpit is protected with a headrest mounted turnover structure and the 33 or 40 cubic foot cargo bin (217 gallons or 1,200 pounds) is located in front of the pilot over the airplane's center of gravity. The non-retractable fixed landing gear is of the conventional steerable tailwheel type with cantilever spring steel main landing gear legs. The wings are constructed of aluminum with two spars and are covered with a combination of aluminum sheet and fabric. All four outer wing panels are identical to make them interchangeable in the field. This feature also substantially reduces the spares inventory required. The tail unit structure is of the braced steel tube type and is fabric covered.

It was a prototype built exclusively for the Curtiss V-8 engine. Because of the size of the engine, the seat was mounted behind the power plant so that the rider would not get burned. This in turn necessitated extra long handle bars, which made steering awkward. It used an automobile rear wheel and a motorcycle front wheel. The tires were manufactured by B.F. Goodrich. The machine was not equipped with any suspension system at all. Only the small springs on the seat cushioned the operator's ride. Needless to state, the ride was anything but smooth."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Curtiss V-8 engine was air-cooled, producing approximately 30 to 40 horsepower at 1,800 rpm.

A large bevel gear on this shaft meshed with a similar one on the rear wheel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The engine had two carburetors, each one supplying four of the eight cylinders on each side. There was no choke. The transmission was direct drive, with no clutch. The F-type cylinders were cast of special hard gray iron that was very durable. They were carefully ground and lapped to ensure near perfect compression. The cylinders were set at 90 degrees and were of two-piece design. They had a bore of 3 5/8 inches and the stroke was 3 1/4 inches. The head and pistons were also cast iron. The crankcase was of aluminum. Each of the pistons was fitted with four rings. The intake valves were automatic, atmospheric operated. The exhaust valve was push rod-operated from the camshaft. Curtiss used strong forged alloy steel for the internal components. The individual thin-wall cylinders and the head were attached to the crankcase with high tensile nickel alloy steel studs, contributing to the better-than-average lightness of the overall engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Jump spark ignition was used, energized by dry cell batteries.

The judges agreed upon a two-mile run to get up to speed, one mile for the actual test, and two miles to stop the motorcycle. The machine's braking system was minimal, looking like something that would be found on a geared bicycle. It was a hinged paddle device on the rear tire, which did not permit a quick stop. Tom Baldwin and \"Tank\" Waters, who traveled with Curtiss, positioned themselves on either side of the machine and pushed the motorcycle until the engine started.

British successes against German daylight bombers forced the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) to shift to night bombing. By the time Royal Air Force (RAF) Spitfires could launch, climb out, and then try to intercept these raids, the bombers crews had usually dropped their loads and turned for home. An aircraft was needed to patrol the skies over England for up to seven hours during the night, and then follow radar vectors to attack German aircraft before they reached their target. U.S. Army Air Corps officers noted this requirement and decided that America must have a night fighter if and when it entered the war."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Army awarded a contract to Northrop on January 30, 1941. The resulting design featured twin tail booms and rudders for stability when the aircraft closed in behind an intruder. It was a large aircraft with a big fuel load and two powerful engines. Armament evolved into four 20 mm cannons mounted in the belly firing forward and a powered, remote-controlled turret on top of the center fuselage equipped with four .50 cal. machine guns. The three-man crew consisted of the pilot, a gunner seated behind him, and a radar observer/gunner at the rear behind the gun turret. Only the pilot could fire the cannons but any of the three could operate the machine guns."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Simultaneously, work was proceeding, at a laboratory run by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to develop the airborne radar set. The Army tested an early design in a Douglas B-18 in 1941. The much-improved SCR-520 set was ready by early 1942. Meanwhile, Army enthusiasm for the XP-61 produced another contract on March 10, 1941, for 13 service-test YP-61s. Even before these airplanes flew, Northrop received orders for 410 production machines! Northrop test pilot Vance Breeze flew the aircraft on May 26, 1942. Although the Black Widow was nearly as large as a medium bomber, it was a true fighter. The only prohibited flight maneuvers were outside loops, sustained inverted flight, and deliberate spins."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As Northrop advanced the design toward production, supply problems arose and modifications became necessary. The 4-gun top turret was the same type fitted to the top forward position on the Boeing B-29 Superfortress (see NASM collection) and that bomber had production priority over the P-61. As a result, several hundred P-61s did not have this turret. Those that did experienced buffeting when the turret was traversed from side to side and a fix took time. By October 1943, the first P-61s were coming off the line. Training started immediately, and the first night fighters arrived in the European Theater by March 1944. Combat operations began just after D-Day (June 6) and the Black Widows quickly departed from their original role as defensive interceptors and became aggressors. They flew deep into German airspace, bombing and strafing trains and road traffic and making travel difficult for the enemy by day and at night."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"P-61s arrived in the Pacific Theater at about the same time as the European Black Widows. For years, the Japanese had operated lone bombers over Allied targets at night and now U. S. fighters could locate and attack them. However, on June 30, 1944, a Mitsubishi BETTY (see NASM collection) became the first P-61 kill in the Pacific. Soon, Black Widows controlled the night skies. On the night of August 14-15, a P-61 named \"Lady in the Dark\" by her crew encountered an intruding Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa (Peregrine Falcon) OSCAR (see NASM collection) and eventually forced it into the sea without firing a shot. Although the war was officially over, no one was sure that all of the Japanese had heard the message and stopped fighting. The American night fighters flew again the next night and \"Lady in the Dark\" again found a target. It was a Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (Demon) TOJO and the fighters maneuvered wildly as they attempted to gain an advantage. The P-61 crew lost and reacquired the Ki-44 several times then finally lost it for good and returned to base. The next day ground troops found the wrecked TOJO. In the darkness, Lady in the Dark's crew had forced the Japanese pilot to fly into the ground, again without firing a shot."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the war over, the Army cancelled further production. Northrop had built 706 aircraft including 36 with a highly modified center fuselage. These F-15As (later redesignated RF-61C) mounted a number of cameras in the nose and proved able reconnaissance platforms. Many of these airplanes participated in the first good aerial photographic survey of the Pacific islands. A few, plus some special purpose P-61s, stayed in active service until 1950."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"NASM's Black Widow is a P-61C-1-NO, U.S. Army Air Forces serial number 43-8330. Northrop delivered it to the Army on July 28, 1945. By October 18, this P-61 was flying at Ladd Field, Alaska, in cold weather tests and it remained there until March 30, 1946. This airplane later moved to Pinecastle Air Force Base, Florida, for participation in the National Thunderstorm Project. The project's goal was to learn more about thunderstorms and to use this knowledge to better protect civil and military airplanes that operated near them. The U. S. Weather Bureau and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) undertook the study with cooperation from the Army Air Forces and Navy. With its radar and particular flight characteristics, the P-61 was capable of finding the most turbulent regions of a storm, penetrating them, and returning crew and instruments intact for detailed study."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Pinecastle personnel removed the guns and turret from 43-8330 in July 1946 to make room for new equipment.

In fact, the instrumented balloons had entered the stratosphere, an atmospheric region first identified by the French meteorologist Teis-serenc de Bort on the basis of his own experiments with sounding balloons in 1899."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"For the newspaper-reading public of the decade 1926-1936, the stratosphere was far more than a layer of sky that began roughly ten miles above the surface of the earth at the equator. The word stratosphere conjured up images similar to those that \"darkest Africa\" had evoked in the nineteenth century or the names Arctic and Antarctic in the early twentieth. Like an unexplored continent, it was a region to be visited by only the most intrepid explorers, members of well-financed and well-equipped expeditions. In fact, no one took a greater interest in the exploration of the stratosphere than the National Geographic Society, the same organization that had supported Robert Peary's first trip to the North Pole. As in the case of geographic exploration, international rivalries were played out in the stratosphere, with the United States and the Soviet Union trading the world's absolute altitude record back and forth while the world press urged them on."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"More than any other figure, Capt. Hawthorne Gray ushered in the age of the great stratosphere expeditions. A native of Pasco, Washington, born on February 16, 1889, Gray was the son of Capt. William P. Gray, a well-known steamboat skipper, and the grandson of a member of Marcus Whitman's mission to the Indians of the Northwest. After graduating from the University of Idaho, he enlisted as an infantry private for service in the Mexican Punitive Expedition of 1916, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant on June 2, 1917. Gray was transferred to the Army Air Service with the rank of captain in 1920. By 1924 he had graduated from the balloon school at Ross Field, the airship school at Scott Field, and the primary flying school at Brooks Field. Assigned as engineering officer to Scott Field in Belleville, Illinois, Gray quickly became a key figure in army lighter-than-air circles. His second-place finish in the 1926 Gordon Bennett race identified him in the public mind as one of the best-known of the nation's military balloonists."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hawthorne Gray's career as a stratosphere balloonist began with a flight to 28,510 feet from Scott Field on March 9, 1927. As on his subsequent high-altitude ascents, science played a small role in the planning for the first flight. It was an outright attempt to capture the world's absolute altitude record. While Gray's three ventures into the upper atmosphere did offer an opportunity to test high-altitude clothing, oxygen systems, instruments, and other items of equipment required for aircraft operations in the substratosphere, Air Corps publicity releases emphasized the fact that this was an attempt to set a record."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's instruments (a statoscope, a 50,000-foot altimeter, a thermograph, and a rate of climb indicator) were flight oriented and not designed to provide scientific information. There was little doubt that the most important instruments carried aboard the balloon were twin barographs sealed by officials of the NAA. The record of altitude that appeared on the strips of paper inside these instruments would serve as the basis for official recognition of Gray's position as the world's highest man."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The balloon employed, Army No. S-30-241, was a single-ply rubberized silk envelope coated with aluminum paint. The 70,000-cubic-foot bag, loaded with supplies and instruments, weighed 726 pounds. The ballast consisted of 4,520 pounds of sand, packed in bags suspended from a special rack on the load ring. In an effort to make one final push to an absolute ceiling, Gray proposed to discard the useless weight of the rack once all the sand had been dropped. Ross Asbill, foreman of the fabric shop at Scott Field, had sewn special small parachutes so that Gray could drop heavy objects, including the ballast rack and empty oxygen bottles, without endangering those below."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's oxygen system consisted of three 200-inch tanks mounted high on the side of the basket so that they could be shoved overboard with less effort. A 100-inch tank was held in reserve for use as a jump bottle in the event the aeronaut was forced to abandon his balloon at altitude. The three primary oxygen cylinders fed through two pressure valves. Gray received oxygen through a rather primitive oxygen mask covering his mouth."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When Gray emerged from a Scott Field hangar on the afternoon of March 9, 1927, the 183-pound aeronaut, clad in 57 pounds of clothing, appeared, according to one observer, like \"a large brown bear preparing for winter hiber-nation.\"7 Gray himself remarked: \"Over the heaviest of woolen underwear I wore two woolen shirts, a sweater and a winter uniform. On top of that was a flying suit, leather on the outside, reindeer fawn skin on the inside, and two thicknesses of heavy woolen blanket cloth between.\"8 His boots were fleece-lined, high-topped leather moccasins laced at the front and back. A leather helmet, upper face cover, mouth mask, goggles, and mittens completed his outfit."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's first record attempt began promptly 1:18 p.m., when, after checking the instruments, the distribution of ballast, and his oxygen system, the aeronaut tuned in a jazz melody on his seven-tube Atwater-Kent radio and gave the command, \"O.K., let her go.\" One chase plane followed Gray aloft, while two Signal Corps theodolites established on a three-mile north-south baseline tracked Gray from the time of take-off until he disappeared from view moments before landing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The aeronaut's problems began soon after lift-off. He had planned a leisurely ascent that would permit time to check radio reception and conduct instrument observations. In fact, he had time to do little more than heft the individual ballast bags into the car, slit each one with a knife, and dump the contents over the side. It was an exhausting task that required Gray to dispose of 2¼ tons of ballast by hand. As he passed through 25,000 feet, the oxygen system was also proving less than satisfactory, pouring out a stream of frigid gas painful to breathe."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray passed out at 27,000 feet. The balloon continued to climb to 28,510 feet, then began to drop rapidly. The aeronaut regained consciousness at 17,000 feet, only to discover that he was falling at the frightening rate of 1,200 feet per minute. He immediately resumed dumping ballast, abandoning each of his three knives as they became dull, ripping the seams out of the bags by hand. Gray slowed his descent to 600 feet per minute, finally tearing through a set of telephone lines to make a hard landing near Ashley, Illinois, some 40 miles southwest of Scott Field."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The chase plane landed and returned Gray to the post hospital, where he made a rapid recovery. While the aeronaut had set a new U.S. altitude mark, he fell far short of the 35,424-foot record set by Suring and Berson. He had, nevertheless, created much favorable publicity for the Army Air Corps. More important, he could now provide some sound advice on the subject of flying clothing, oxygen systems, and other items of equipment for high-altitude flights."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"His helmet, for example, had been almost completely unsatisfactory. In the future, he planned to adapt a gas mask to his needs. Such a mask would provide a tighter seal on his face to conserve oxygen and make breathing easier. Oxygen would pass from the cylinder through an asbestos-covered canister where the gas was heated by electrical coils operated by a two-volt battery. The oxygen exited the canister, which was strapped on the aeronaut's chest, and entered the mask through flat pipes located near the inside of the goggles to prevent fogging at altitude."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Thus equipped, Gray was ready for a second altitude attempt from Scott Field on May 4,1927. The aeronaut had a very specific goal for this, his 107th ascent. He intended not only to beat Suring and Berson's balloon altitude record but to climb above the absolute world mark of 40,820 feet set by French aviator Jean Callizo the previous year."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray had no illusions about the dangers involved. He knew that somewhere between 40,000 and 50,000 feet the air pressure would be so reduced that his lungs would not function and gases would begin to bubble out of his blood. Gray would be venturing very close to the absolute ceiling, where a human being could no longer survive without artificial pressurization."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The flight began well. Gray rose rapidly toward his maximum altitude, anxious to clinch the record before oxygen shortage became a problem. Each item of equipment functioned properly. He was able to relax on the way up, listening to jazz tunes and watching his instruments. Within forty-five minutes he was approaching his ceiling."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"\"At 42,000 feet, having been kept alive by compressed oxygen for the last four miles, I was listening to a jazz orchestra playing in St. Louis, the music coming in clear and loud on my radio, without a single trace of static. That was the only connecting link with the world I had left. Far below, cruising along the top of the cloud banks at 13,000 feet, two escort planes, one with a movie photographer aboard and the other with the post surgeon as passenger, hovered and watched me, though I could not pick them out of the mist. Below them the clouds covered the land, except for an occasional rift. Once through such a crevasse, I caught a magnificent view of the Mississippi and Missouri, tracing their winding course for miles and miles to the north and south. \""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The sky, Gray noted, \"was magnificent in the depth of coloring, which was a deep, almost cobalt, blue.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"His sand ballast was gone at 40,000 feet. In order to climb higher, he parachuted the first of his twenty-five pound oxygen cylinders overboard. This sent him up another few thousand feet, high enough to insure his hold on the world record."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"\"At that height, though still distended, I knew the gas bag above contained less than one-eighth of the gas I had started with. As the balloon had climbed into lighter air and the pressure against it was removed, the gas had rushed out through the big appendix in the bottom, keeping the silvered fabric from bursting. So long as I stayed up, the balloon would be full, but once 1 started down the gas would begin to contract under the increasing air pressure, so that if I could keep all the gas I had, there still would be less than 10,000 cubic feet when I reached the ground. \""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After bouncing up and down for a few minutes at 42,240 feet, Gray valved gas to start back down. Low on gas, low on ballast, he faced the classic dilemma of the free balloonist. As his descent picked up speed, he began dumping everything disposable overboard. Keeping one eye on the statoscope, which indicated his rate of fall, Gray knew he was in trouble, and increased his attempts to lighten the load by parachuting equipment."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"\"The parachutes were designed to fall at sixteen feet a second, the same rate as the large chutes used by flyers, but the bag was falling so much more rapidly that when I dropped things over the sides they appeared to fly straight up in the air. It was queer to see twenty-five pound steel bottles apparently flying upwards. Two more oxygen tanks, the storage battery used to run the electric heater in my oxygen mask, my radio batteries and loud speaker, and finally the wooden frame-work which supported the ballast bags, with all the empty bags still attached, were released to lighten the balloon.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Passing through 8,000 feet, Gray could see trees and marshlands rushing up to meet him. Unable to slow his drop below 1,800 feet per minute, twice the safe landing speed, he climbed onto the side of the basket, balanced himself with one hand on the load ring, and jumped. Drifting to earth beneath his parachute canopy, Gray could see the balloon, free of his weight, rise at last, as the Air Service camera plane circled. He landed safely 1 10 miles from Belleville one hour and twenty minutes after take-off."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The precious barograph instruments were found undamaged with the bal-loon, ten miles from Gray's landing spot. They indicated that the flight had reached a crest at 42,240 feet. Ultimately, however, the effort to capture the altitude record failed. In spite of all the arguments advanced by officials of the NAA, the FAI ruled that because Gray did not land with his balloon, the record would be disallowed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As before, the flight of May 4, 1927, provided important information on oxygen equipment, clothing, and instruments. Gray, however, was more deter-mined than ever to capture the altitude title and immediately began planning a third flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Army Air Corps officials, anxious to avoid the charge of publicity seeking, issued statements to the effect that \"Captain Gray's flight was not made with the intention of breaking any records but for the purpose of studying atmospheric conditions at high altitude.\"' Newspapers were ready to accept this position. The New York Times commented that meteorologists would be more interested in the results of Gray's effort than military officials. \"It is,\" remarked the Times, \"another case of the Army Air Service laying science under obligation.\" Successful Air Corps propaganda notwithstanding, it was apparent that the third flight of Hawthorne Gray was nothing more than an all-out effort to set an official world altitude record."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The aeronaut lifted off on his third altitude flight from Scott Field on November 4, 1927. After bidding good-bye to his wife and son, Gray took off at 2:24 P.M., accompanied by four chase planes. Fifty-mile-per-hour winds were blowing at 1,600 feet that day, and much higher at Gray's altitude. The aircraft pilots, who had had little difficulty maintaining contact with the balloon on previous occasions, now lost sight of Gray when he flew into a cloud bank over McLeansboro, Illinois. The aircraft continued south, hoping to spot the balloon again, but were finally forced to scatter and land at Henderson and Madisonville, Kentucky, late that afternoon. Gray, they knew, had to be on the ground by this time, probably someplace farther south. At the time, however, they could only hope for the best and wait for Gray to send word of his location."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The young boy who found the mortal remains of Hawthorne Charles Gray in the trees near Sparta, Tennessee, early on the morning of November 5, was quick to inform Sheriff Hawk Templeton. A search party arrived on the scene soon thereafter with a number of phone linemen to retrieve the balloon from the trees and an undertaker to take charge of the body. There was little doubt about who this was. Nashville papers had headlined the news of Gray's disappearance in the previous evening edition. Positive identification came from papers on the body. Noting the instruments and papers in the basket, Sheriff Templeton posted a guard at the crash site, then started back for Sparta with the body."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Postmaster S. C. Dodson wired the news to Washington with a request for instructions on where the body should be shipped. The news found its way onto the Associated Press wire as well. That afternoon two of the army chase planes were headed directly for Sparta, while the other two flew to Blackwood Field in Nashville to wait for orders. Only one aircraft, flown by Sgt. S. J. Sampson with Capt. C. J. Bryan as his observer, actually arrived on the scene. The other airplane bound for Sparta was forced down short of its destination, with no injury to the crew."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Col. John Paegelow, a First World War balloon veteran commanding Scott Field, gradually took charge of the situation. Gray's body was sent on to Washington for burial at Arlington National Cemetery. A board of three, including a flight surgeon and two balloon officers, was appointed from the Scott Field staff to investigate the causes of the disaster."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On the basis of the instruments found in the basket and a hastily scribbled log that Gray had kept during the flight, the details of the tragedy came into focus. Station KNOX had been playing \"Kashmiri\" at take-off. The ascent was much more leisurely than on either previous flight. In March Gray had reached 28,510 feet in forty minutes. This time he required an hour to reach that point. In May he attained 42,240 feet in one hour and five minutes. He required almost two hours to reach the same ceiling on November 4."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's slower pace is not difficult to explain. On both previous flights he had dumped ballast with wild abandon, attempting to rise as quickly as possible before the oxygen ran low. The result had been far too rapid a descent with no ballast left to slow his fall. It seems that Gray was now sufficiently comfortable with his oxygen apparatus that he was willing to take a chance on a very slow climb, which would permit him to conserve ballast for landing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"He was enjoying the radio during the leisurely ascent. KSD was coming in loud and clear at 12,000 feet. As Gray noted, he was beginning to feel \"symptoms of rickets\" as a result of the falling pressure. At 15,000 feet he turned the batteries on his electrical oxygen heater from two to four volts. The electrical heater for the lenses of a pair of experimental goggles was also switched on as the lenses began to fog. The thermometer read zero as the balloon passed through 19,000 feet at 3:05 p.m. Gray had switched channels now and was enjoying a saxophone solo of \"Traumeri.\" At 3:10 P.M. he was at 23,000 feet, listening to \"Thinking of You\" on KNOX. Five minutes and a thousand feet later, \"Just Another Day Wasted Away\" was spilling out into that cobalt blue sky from WLW in Cincinnati. It was even colder, 25 degrees below, at 3:17. The Pied Piper was entertaining over Chicago's WLS."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's fate may well have been sealed with an entry penciled into the log at 3:17: \"Clock frozen.\" Now he was literally reduced to guessing his time in the air and the amount of oxygen remaining in the tanks."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray's first tank was exhausted before he reached 34,000 feet. He opened the cock on the second tank, closed the valve on the junction box of the empty cylinder, cut the hoses and lashings, and hefted it overboard to float to earth. As the cylinder tumbled free, it struck the long trailing radio antenna, ripping it from the basket. Gray was absolutely alone now. \"No more music.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The journal entries continued in a shakier hand now. Gray was in the stratosphere, and the temperature was rising a bit and stabilizing. At 39,000 feet, the bag was fully distended. A thousand feet higher, the sand ballast completely gone, Gray noted that the sky was a very deep blue and the sun was bright."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This was the last entry in the log, but the barograph continued to run, providing an exact record of the balloon's movements. The craft was oscillating between 42,200 and 42,100 feet. At about 4:05 there was a sudden jump up to the peak altitude, 42,470 feet. We can assume that this jump represents the point at which Gray dropped the radio batteries that Jack Fisher, the field hand, saw descending to earth a few minutes later."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gray was obviously still alive. He valved gas on the next down oscillation, and was on his way back to earth at last. The descent was slow and steady until he reached 39,000 feet at 4:28 P.M. Now the balloon started down much more rapidly. Gray, probably realizing for the first time that he was running low on oxygen, had valved gas again. The aeronaut's oxygen should, according to his own calculations, have run out at 4:38 p.m., at which time he was still descending through air far too thin to breathe. He must have fallen unconscious by this time, for the barograph track shows a slow, steady descent toward a landing in that grove of trees near Sparta, Tennessee, at 5:20 p.m."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Scott Field board of inquiry had few doubts about the ultimate cause of Gray's death. \"There is one thought-if the clock had only not stopped.\" Gray's determination to achieve the record explained the slow ascent. The aeronaut's confidence in his own experience with the oxygen system led him to continue his climb after the failure of the clock. When he realized that his oxygen was running out, he was either unable to jump or unwilling to do so, knowing that it would cost him the record. Gray's determination to gain official recognition as the world's highest man had ultimately cost him his life."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The trappings of a hero were heaped on Gray. After burial in Arlington, he was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross \"for heroism while participating in aerial flights.\" \"His courage,\" noted the citation, \"was greater than his supply of oxygen.\" In 1938 the Army Air Corps named a facility at Fort Lewis, Washington, in his honor. None of this would be of much help to Gray's widow and three sons, who received his Air Corps insurance and $2, 700, the equivalent of six months' pay."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hawthorne Gray's death underscored the central problem facing high-altitude balloonists. To fly above 40,000 feet without a pressure garment or the protection of a pressurized vessel was to invite death. It was a problem that attracted the attention of would-be stratosphere balloonists in the United States and Europe."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Within a year of the event, Paul E.

The first King Air, powered by Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A-6 engines, flew on January 20, 1964 and, after the prototype completed a 230-hour test program, the design received its type certificate on May 27, 1964. The first production aircraft deliveries began in late 1964."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The design was a low-wing cantilever monoplane of aluminum construction with retractable tricycle landing gear. To improve its utility and safety in changing flight conditions, standard equipment, that had been optional on the Queen Air, included de-icing boots on the leading edges of the wings, fin, and tailplane. Flight instruments allowed for all-weather capabilities and various communications and navigation packages included autopilot, radio, and radar systems. The Model 90 had two seats in the cockpit and four reclining passenger seats facing each other in the cabin, with options for a two or three-place couch for passengers. Air conditioning and soundproofing also improved passenger comfort in the cabin. Two 500-hp P&W Canada PT6A-6 turboprop engines with three-blade Hartzell propellers gave the King Air a top ceiling of 27,400 feet and a range of 1,565 miles at 270 mph. Piston-powered aircraft could not match this performance while emerging jet aircraft of the 1960s used turbojet engines that were high-priced, noisy, and had high fuel consumption."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rather than investing in a completely new and expensive technology, Beech built a vastly improved and marketable business aircraft from its existing production line. After the King Air's initial success, Beech concentrated on continuous upgrades to appeal to a range of executive and corporate needs. Sophisticated electronics packages, increased cabin space, and finer interior amenities in Models 90, 100, 200, 300, and 350 provided comfortable working and transport environments for business travelers. Newer models are longer and sport T-tails, but the basic configuration remains the same and continues to appeal as a new or previously owned medium-range aircraft. In addition to the airframe, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine family consistently provides a high level of performance and reliability. Nearly 40 years since its introduction, the King Air series is still the king of the turboprops and fills a significant niche in the business aviation marketplace."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Museum's aircraft, LJ-34, is an early model with both the Queen Air and King Air designations, 65-90, meaning it was a Queen Air 88 design upgraded with P&W Canada PT6A-6 engines. One hundred and twelve of these models were built. The aircraft received its airworthiness certificate on April 16, 1965 and was registered as N1920H. The exterior was white with Morning Glory Blue and Jubilee Gold trim and the interior was Frontier Green, Black and Arctic Beige. On April 23, 1965, the Aviation Department of Helmerich and Payne, Inc., of Tulsa, Oklahoma, purchased the aircraft and the company flew the aircraft almost every other day for many years, mostly around the Central Plains states. The aircraft's registration changed to N10LE on October 8, 1973 and it flew in California, until May 20, 1976, when the registration was changed to N275DP. I FLY SOUTH of Wilmington, Delaware, owned the aircraft by 1994 and it then returned to Raytheon's Beech Aircraft Corporation in March 1998. Stevens Aviation, of Vandalia, Ohio, performed general maintenance and painted it white with red and gray trim before Raytheon flew it to National Airport near Washington, DC, in April 1998. There, its flight career ended with 7,164.5 hours on the airframe. It was disassembled and trucked across the Potomac River to the Museum for installation in the Business Wings exhibit. In July of 2000, when the exhibit closed, Raytheon donated the aircraft to the Museum."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400024891-1","title":"Capsule, Mercury","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d64e7729-a8b9-4c9f-951b-2c8f4ac1d056","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"On September 9, 1959, NASA launched this unoccupied Mercury spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a suborbital flight that lasted 13 minutes.

A fixed, water-cooled engine, capable of generating at least 150 horsepower, was in his view the power plant of the future. At this time, just such an engine was undergoing trials. It was a new Hispano-Suiza V-8, designed by that company's founder and chief designer, a Swiss-born engineer named Marc Birkigt. The engine was a great step forward in that it had a much better power-to-weight ratio than previous water-cooled designs, as well as many other modern features. The new Hispano-Suiza engine was just what Béchereau was calling for. He designed his next airframe around the advanced Hispano-Suiza motor; the result was the famous Spad VII.

Tom Baldwin and \"Tank\" Waters, who traveled with Curtiss, positioned themselves on either side of the machine and pushed the motorcycle until the engine started. Curtiss recorded a speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during the run.

Airframe weight totaled about 118 kg (260 lb), a mere 1.8 kg (4 lb) above the legal weight limit for ultralights but the Moni was at least two times faster.

Following the production of this aircraft through 1929, the Navy requirement for a new primary flight traininer for the 1930s prompted the development of an important series of biplanes that served from 1938 through World War II. The N3N model, manufactured by the Navy Aircraft Factory (NAF) in Philadelphia answered the need. The N3N was used extensively as the primary trainer until the end of WWII. Outwardly, this aircraft appeared similar to the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3. The major difference in the N3N was its structure, which featured riveted extruded aluminum fuselage construction with removable side panels for ease of inspection and maintenance. The wings, also constructed internally of all metal, were covered with fabric like the fuselage and tail."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following successful tests at Philadelphia and Anacostia, as both a land-plane and a single-float seaplane, the Navy ordered production with a 220 horsepower Wright J-5 radial engine. The prototype, US Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) Number 9991, went through service trials during February and March 1936. The trials recommended minor modifications, leading to the creation of another version, the XN3N-2. The NAF built one hundred and seventy-nine N3N-1s, with the first one delivered in June 1936. A fourth N3N-1 (BuAer # 0020) was modified as another prototype, XN3N-3. These two aircraft were fitted with navy built versions of the 240 hp Wright J-6-7 (R-760-96) engine, which was the same as that used in the NY-3s since 1929. The N3N-3, of which 816 were built, differed slightly from the -1. It had a redesigned vertical tail and a single strut landing gear. The N3N-1 was produced with a distinctive anti-drag ring around the engine, but the N3N-3s did not have this feature."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The N3N's nickname, \"Yellow Peril\", came from the aircraft's propensity for \"ground looping\" on landing. The narrow landing gear, only 72 1/2 inches from the centerline of each tire, did not provide much lateral stability at higher touchdown speeds. Many naval aviation cadets learned about this feature the hard way during primary flight training."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The engine was started by using a hand crank. The crank was inserted and vigorously turned until the inertia flywheel achieved sufficient momentum and the starter T-handle was pulled. Taxiing the N3N required a series of \"S\" turns because forward visibility was partially blocked by the engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Take off in calm winds within 600 feet were normal. A neutral control stick position with full throttle and 2,000 rpm was all that was needed to get the N3N flying. Landings were best-done using the full-stall technique. The N3N was flown over the fence at about 57-60 knots (65-70 mph) and stalled at 44 knots (50 mph) with a full load. Visibility was better from the back seat for landing. Cockpit instrumentation consisted of an altimeter, tachometer, airspeed indicator, compass, turn and bank indicator, and a combination fuel and oil temperature and pressure gauge. The aircraft could climb at 900 feet per minute and cruise at 87 knots (100 mph), at 1800 rpm. Climbing and gliding were accomplished at 65 knots. The aircraft's service ceiling was 15,200 feet (4,632 m).

When he stepped out of the Bonanza at Teterboro, he was clean-shaven and neatly dressed, as any young executive might be on arrival for a business conference. Following the Honolulu-to-Teterboro flight, Odom made a national tour with the Bonanza, after which it was turned over to the National Air Museum."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1951 the plane was returned to Beech Aircraft to be refurbished and lent to Congressman Peter F. Mack, Jr., for a solo worldwide goodwill flight. Leaving Springfield, Illinois, on October 7, 1951, the plane, rechristened Friendship Flame, visited forty-five major cities in thirty-one countries. Concerned with rising hotspots and international tensions, Mack met with ordinary citizens and dignitaries on his self-directed and self-funded global dialogue and peace mission. It provided a snapshot of a post-World War II and nuclear age world and made international headlines. Mack held talks with leaders of Middle East countries on the verge of dramatic change and stopped in Korea despite the ongoing war but was denied permission to enter the Soviet Union. Mack flew over mountains, deserts, and water in all kinds of weather and became the first person to solo the Pacific Ocean. He returned to Springfield, Illinois, on January 27, 1952, about 33,000 miles and 113 days after his depature. Congressman Mack flew the plane to Wichita, Kansas on April 19, 1952. It was later returned to the National Air Museum."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Waikiki Beech/Friendship Flame was the fourth Bonanza built: the only modifications made to the otherwise standard Model 35 were the fixtures and tubing required to install the extra fuel tanks, 126 gallons in the cabin and a 62-gallon streamlined tank on each wing tip. The Bonanza is regarded as a classic aircraft design of the post-World War II era and is easily identified by its distinctive V-tail. Though a number of other design refinements contributed to the efficiency of this airplane, the \"butterfly tail\" is the most distinguishing outward characteristic. This unique feature was tested during the waning years of World War II and found promising. The most important advantages of this design were the reduction in the number of parts and in weight. Control response with the V-tail is equivalent to conventional tail surfaces of 40 percent greater area."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Early in 1975 the aircraft was once again refurbished by Beech for exhibit in the new National Air and Space Museum.

Curtiss returned to the United States an international hero."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1911, Curtiss began to concentrate on the military market and specifically on the aviation requirements of the U.S. Navy. The Navy purchased three Curtiss airplanes in 1911. Shortly before, Curtiss pilot Eugene Ely created a sensation when he made a successful takeoff from the USS Birmingham on November 14, 1910. He built upon the feat on January 18, 1911, when he landed a Curtiss pusher on a platform built on the after deck of the cruiser, USS Pennsylvania. After having lunch with naval officers in the wardroom, Ely took off from the same platform and flew back to shore. The flights marked the beginning of carrier aviation."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Curtiss continued the evolution of the pusher design with the development of the D-II (the Golden Flyer was considered the Model D), which relocated the ailerons from the front interplane struts to the rear ones. The latter change improved the efficiency of the wings and the ailerons."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The development of the D-III quickly followed. This model incorporated covering on both the top and bottom surfaces of the wings, enclosing the ribs and spars and adding 3 to 6 mph in speed. The forward elevator was moved back slightly and placed almost directly above the front wheel, and elevators were added to the rear in place of the fixed horizontal stabilizer formerly used on the D and D-II models. The addition of elevators in the rear led directly to the development of the Curtiss D-III Headless Pusher, which resulted from a propitious accident incurred by noted exhibition pilot, Lincoln Beachey."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While flying in a competition, Beachey hit a fence upon landing which destroyed the front elevator.

Mrs. Keith Miller, a noted woman pilot of the era, entered one in the 1929 National Air Tour and placed 8th in a heavily competitive field of entries. Another C-4C/KR-34C was used as the official press plane for the Air Tour. The C-4C was popular as an air taxi and as a sport aircraft, too. The recently expanded plant in Hagerstown produced a number of the C-4Cs before sales were severely curtailed by the stock market crash in late 1929.

N500RA was a production 500S business aircraft, with the exception of smoke and propeller unfeathering systems. He painted it in a distinctive white and green paint scheme, with his name on the top of each wing. Hoover's routine demonstrated the Shrike's excellent high and low-speed handling capabilities, and its one-engine and no-engine performance. But because it was a stock business aircraft that lacked highly modified engines and quick climb or turn characteristics, the Shrike Commander was a more challenging aircraft for air show flight than his P-51 fighter.

The aircraft had a fixed landing gear that was well faired with wheel pants and powered by a 420-hp Wright R-760 engine. It had a steel-tube fuselage and wing spar structure. The upper wing was inversely staggered behind the lower wing, and this design gave the Model 17 its unique shape and name. The fuselage was faired with wood formers and stringers and was covered with fabric. Top speed of the aircraft was more than 200 mph and yet the landing speed was only 60-65 mph. Such performance was remarkable for the time. But despite its promise, the aircraft was difficult to sell, largely because of its high cost. Clearly, some compromises in performance had to be made if it was to be more competitive."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1934, Beech introduced the Model B17L, a new series retaining the general design of the earlier airplanes. The major modifications were the installation of a retractable landing gear, wings of a different airfoil, the use of wood wing spars instead of steel ones, and a 225-hp Jacobs L-4 power plant. The use of retractable gear, which was not common at the time, as well as parallel improvements in streamlining and weight reduction, gave the aircraft a maximum speed of 175 mph and a landing speed of 45 mph. The Beech Company advertised the performance and economy of the new series and emphasized the pilot's visibility from the aircraft and the airplane's gentle stall characteristics, both resulting from the negative staggered wing arrangement. The redesigned aircraft had hit the target, and sales improved significantly."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The company also built two Model Al7s with a fixed landing gear and Wright R-1820 Cyclone engines. The engine on the second of these two powerful aircraft developed 710 hp. The aircraft had a maximum speed of 250 mph, making it the fastest commercial aircraft of its time and the fastest Model 17 ever built. Although the performance of the early Model 17s was impressive, the aircraft did not have desirable landing characteristics. The tall landing gear increased the chances of ground loops and the nose-heavy condition made three-point landings difficult. The Model C17 introduced in 1936 corrected these problems. It had a shorter landing gear, and the angle of incidence of the horizontal stabilizer was changed to keep the tail down while landing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the Staggerwing, the Beech Corporation not only had a successful corporate aircraft, but was a winner in racing circles too. NC15835, a Model C17R, piloted by Louise Thaden and Blanche Noyes, won the 1936 Bendix Trophy Race, marking the first time that a woman had won that prestigious race. Other stock Beechcraft Staggerwings won two major air races in Miami in 1936. In 1937, Jacqueline Cochran set a 1,000-kilometer speed record averaging more than 320 kph (200 mph).

The ailerons were moved to the upper wings to prevent interference with the air flow over the flaps. The complex hand-operated wheel brakes were replaced with a simplified foot-operated braking system. These and other airframe modifications significantly improved the design of the Staggerwing. The Model D17S Staggerwing, equipped with a 450-hp Pratt and Whitney R-985 engine, was produced in larger numbers than any other model.

Several repairs to the wings were the result of the aircraft's ground looping tendencies. In due course the hand operated brakes were replaced with toe-operated brakes. Shortly after World War II, the aircraft was changed to a Model C17L, with the installation of a newer 225-hp Jacobs L4-MB engine. Even though the Jacobs L4-MBengine had 60 less HP, its installation had negligible impact on aircraft performance due to its adaptability for a much more efficient controllable pitch propeller system. From 1936 to 1980, NC 15840 had nineteen different owners. It was operated by several oil companies as well as by charter and sightseeing businesses. During World War II, it flew coastal patrol duties with the Civil Air Patrol. Between 1961 and 1980 the aircraft was inactive.

Jet engine development, although more advanced in Germany than elsewhere, was still in a primitive state, and the turbine engines intended for the sleek fighter were not ready. On July 19, 1942, Flugkapitän Fritz Wendel made the first takeoff under jet power, and from that point on the Me 262 became a ray of hope in the increasingly dark skies of the German Luftwaffe."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"For a time historians believed that Adolf Hitler's order to build the Me 262 solely as a bomber delayed its introduction into combat as a fighter interceptor.

More important, the PA-11 was the first Cub that could be flown solo from the front seat. The front seat was higher and more forward because of the movement of fuel tanks from the nose to the left wing root section of the aircraft and the resulting change in the center of gravity. The PA-11 was first flown in August 1946 and a total of 1,428 were built between 1947 and 1950."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The PA-18 Super Cub was a strengthened PA-11 with the ability to support up to a 150 hp engine.

The decision to perform these surveys from the air was made on the basis of a comparison of the costs to operate an airborne system to the costs of doing it by conventional geological methods or by the use of ground based vehicles. The rough and sometimes inaccessible terrain to be surveyed made the airborne approach a logical choice based on accessibility, cost and time.

The section chief, who was also the airborne geologist/observer, was required to have sufficient pilot training to be able to handle the airplane in the event of an emergency. The geological instrumentation in the aircraft consisted principally of scintillation measurement equipment, special recording equipment and cameras to record the scintillation profiles, and maps for ground laboratory use.

The wing and tail assemblies were also of wood and were fabric covered. The biplane configuration was a wire braced single bay arrangement in which the top wing was attached to the fuselage with four vertical center section struts. The fuselage mounted lower wing was heavily staggered and was connected to the top wing with outboard \"N\" type interplane struts. The ailerons were located on the top wing. The available engine options were either the 50 hp Anzani radial or the 60 hp Le Rhone radial. The conventional main landing gear had the main wheels displaced forward of the normal axle center and had shock absorbing wooden skids placed aft of the main axle location.

Unfortunately, the selling price for the Sport was $4,850, a fairly hefty price for that era. While the supply of war surplus Standards and Curtiss Jennies was well past its peak by that time, they were still likely to be considerably lower in price than the asking price for the Farman Sport. In terms of performance, by 1926, Ludington was flying the Waco 9 in races instead of the Farman. Lack of Farman sales did not faze Ludington too badly however, because his real intent was to get involved in the emerging airline business.

Small, one-man helicopters were seen as a possible alternative to large, piston powered helicopters that seemed to be at the limit of their development. The military's greatest technical hurdle was to develop an aircraft that was relatively safe and could easily be flown by a combat infantryman. Stanley Hiller, founder and president of Hiller Helicopters, had built a successful business, founded on innovative approaches to helicopter design, and was more than willing to undertake the challenge. Although the flying platforms that resulted from the company's efforts proved to be an aerodynamic dead end, Hiller did demonstrate the practicality of the ducted fan for more conventional forms of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In the late 1940s, noted aeronautical engineer Charles Zimmerman, who had made a name for himself developing Vought's V-173 \"Flying Pancake\" (see NASM collection), began to develop a new approach to vertical flight. He hypothesized that if a small horizontal platform, with a person balancing on top as on a bicycle, was lifted upward by a vertical thrust vector, then the pilot's innate kinesthetic responses would stabilize the platform and also allow it to be controlled in pitch in roll. Although the high center of gravity of such a configuration would seem to result in severe instability, Zimmerman's theory proved correct. If the platform began to tilt in one direction, then the pilot would naturally lean in the other direction to remain upright. This natural balancing tendency would place the center of gravity above the thrust axis, which would result in an upward pitching moment that counteracted the toppling action, thus maintaining a stable condition. The pilot could control the aircraft simply by leaning in the desired direction and the platform would begin to tilt and gain forward momentum. As the aircraft was controlled by instinct, a person could fly it with minimal training, making it ideal for use by soldiers in the field."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Zimmerman set out to construct a flying platform to prove his hypotheses. His first effort consisted of two small target drone engines mounted vertically to the sides of a small steel-tube truss. The pilot was to stand on the truss holding an attached pole. Control for the contraption, nicknamed the \"Flying Shoes,\" was accomplished entirely by weight shifting against the pole. The Flying Shoes suffered instability problems because the engines provided unequal thrust. Stanley Hiller heard about this experiment and was greatly intrigued. In 1948, Zimmerman made a deal that allowed Hiller Helicopters to continue development, while he returned to his old aeronautical engineering position at the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, forerunner of NASA) laboratory in Langley, Virginia."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Unfortunately, Hiller's first successful production helicopter, the UH-12, demanded the company's complete attention and the Flying Shoes were quickly set aside. In the meantime Zimmerman convinced his peers of the merits of his theories and with official support, began to develop new experimental kinesthetically controlled flying platforms. The first of these efforts used compressed air channeled through attached fire hoses for thrust, while the second, known as the Whirligig (see NASM collection), used a compressed air-driven propeller on the underside of a lightweight platform to generate thrust. These developments proved to be extremely easy to fly and were stable in flight, although the larger and heavier Whirligig proved to be less stable and more difficult to control than its predecessor."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The military finally began to take notice of Zimmerman's experiments and issued contracts for the construction of prototypes. On September 17, 1953, the Army initiated contracts with De Lackner and Hiller for kinesthetically-controlled flying platforms. As the Office of Naval Research had pre-existing research programs with Hiller, its leadership agreed to manage the program on behalf of the Army. Engineers from both companies then visited the NACA test facilities to view Zimmerman's progress."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"De Lackner's approach for their DH-4 Aerocycle (HZ-1) was to have the pilot stand atop a large coaxial rotor system. This arrangement was stable and performed well, but any concept that forced the pilot to stand on the airborne equivalent of a food processor with nothing to prevent inadvertent contact with the rotors was unlikely to generate much enthusiasm. Hiller's engineers went back to Zimmerman's original patent application for his Flying Shoes, in which the rotors were to have been located in what he termed as \"venturi rings.\" These consisted of airfoil profiles formed into a circle. The venturi ring would soon become known as a ducted fan. The ducted fan's airfoil accelerated the airflow into the rotors, increasing thrust to a level approximately 40 percent greater than an unducted propeller of the same diameter. Hiller's solved the Flying Shoes' problem of asymmetric thrust by mounting the counter-rotating propellers co-axially. The Model 1031 used two engines, each directly driving one of the rotors inside the 1.52 m (5 ft) diameter duct."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By September 1954, construction had been completed on the Model 1031, which consisted of a fiberglass duct and steel-tube platform. Initial flights were made by Hiller's chief test pilot, Philip T. Johnston. Because there was little to protect the pilot in the event of an engine failure or loss of control, he was tethered to a high wire suspended between two towers. The Model 1031 proved relatively stable, and easy to handle when hovering. A natural self-correcting tendency in forward flight was noted. This occurred because the forward lip of the duct would generate more lift than the trailing edge causing an upward pitching moment. Unfortunately, while this made the platform almost impossible to topple, it also limited the forward speed to a mere 26 kph (16 mph), and resulted in erratic handling in windy conditions."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller engineers realized that an engine failure on either of the engines would result in a catastrophic loss of control. Thus, a new transmission was installed that allowed the combined power of both engines to power the rotors so that if an engine failure occurred, a rapid descent would occur, but no loss of control. This improved design used the same components as the original platform and was designated as the Model 1031-A. On the Model 1031, differential braking on the rotors had controlled yaw, but with the combined transmission, this was no longer an option, so a pair of movable vanes was placed in the ducted fan's inflow to provide a new mechanism for yaw control."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Model 1031-A could not operate out of ground effect because of its limited thrust. Hiller engineers determined that loading on the fixed-pitch rotors' was too high and that the only solution was to use longer rotor blades, which necessitated construction of a larger platform, designated the Model 1031-A-1. By this time, the Department of the Army, dissatisfied with De Lackner's progress, had begun to take over control of Hiller's Navy contract. The new platform, with 2.13 m (7 ft) diameter rotors, which first flew on November 20, 1957, was able to operate successfully out of ground effect, but a new problem was encountered. The increased weight of the platform lowered the center of gravity to the level that kinesthetic control was greatly impaired. Hiller engineers attempted to correct this by raising the pilot's platform. However, controllability was still a problem since the total weight of the platform had increased to the stage where weight shift alone could not insure an adequate level of stability or control. The solution to this was the addition of a gyro-stabilization system that used aerodynamic servos similar to those that Hiller had used on the UH-12. The new system, which was linked to four control vanes in the outflow, improved stability in the hover significantly. The most dramatic illustration of the new system occurred when an Army sniper was able to aim and fire his rifle while hovering in free flight, without any thought to aircraft control. However, in forward flight in anything but the calmest conditions, the platform experienced erratic oscillations that the gyrostabilizer could not dampen out. Various duct configurations were tried, but those that showed the greatest increase in stability also produced the least amount of thrust."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While Hiller was just discovering the extent of the Model 1031-A-1's control problems, the Army placed an order for three upgraded models, for its own experimentation. However the Army insisted that the new platforms, designated VZ-1E, should include a third engine as a backup in case of a failure of either of the two main engines. This requirement necessitated construction of a larger platform, with 2.44 m (8 ft) diameter rotors. The extra weight of the additional engine and larger airframe further increased the control difficulties to the point that kinesthetic control was no longer practical. Hiller attempted to remedy the situation by lengthening the ducted fan for greater stability and developing a more conventional control system in which a seated pilot would maintain control with a stick linked to the control vanes that had originally been intended only for yaw. This latest development proved to have a faster forward flight speed than the Model 1031, but did not resolve the control or instability problems. However, the modified VZ-1E did lead to a new line of thinking."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Hiller engineering team realized that, while they had demonstrated the impracticality of kinesthetically controlled flying platforms in forward flight, the ducted fan idea still held a great deal of promise for more sophisticated VTOL aircraft. Thus, the Office of Naval Research funded the development of a prototype coleopter, or ring-wing VTOL aircraft, consisting of a lengthened ducted fan, which was intended to act as a lifting fuselage when the aircraft pivoted from a vertical to horizontal attitude for high-speed forward flight. A mockup of the coleopter, designated the VXT-8, was constructed, but the design went no further. Control of the coleopter in forward flight would have been extremely difficult. Hiller's final attempt to exploit the merits of the ducted fan was a proposal for an Army \"flying jeep\" competition. The Hiller design, which was not accepted, consisted of four ducted fans powered by a gas turbine attached to a simple frame. Considering Hiller's experience with ducted fans on the Model 1031, the design may well have revolutionized battlefield transportation if a suitable control system had been developed. By this time, however, turbine helicopters such as Bell's new HU-1 Huey, were overcoming many of the hurdles faced by the piston-engine models, and the flying jeep was abandoned."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller's experimentation with the Model 1031/VZ-1E proved to be of little practical use to the company, which went out of business in 1966. However, the company's efforts did validate the ducted fan, which began to see practical service in hovercraft in the 1960s, and has emerged more recently in several Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) prototypes. In spite of its ultimate failure, the flying platform program proved to be a public relations bonanza for Hiller. When photos of the Flying Platform appeared in the media, the public was immediately captivated, perhaps because the platform's lack of visible propulsion seemed to be inspired from the flying saucer frenzy then sweeping the nation. While the apparent successes of the flying platform were widely reported, its inherent aerodynamic flaws were not publicized. Thus, many enthusiasts, even decades later, felt that a viable mode of transport had been unjustly abandoned. As a result, ducted fan platforms have occasionally appeared in the backyards of amateur inventors, who are unaware of the Model 1031's potentially fatal problems. However, the Hiller Flying Platform's vivid demonstrations of the potential of ducted fan technology may yet result in the inspiration for other new approaches to vertical flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rotor Diameter:2.13 m (7 ft) each"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Platform Diameter:2.54 m (8 ft 4 in)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Height:2.13 m (7 ft)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Weight:Empty, 167.8 kg (370 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gross, 251.7 kg (555 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Engine:2 Nelson H-59 two-cycle engines, 40 hp each"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"References and Further Reading:"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gill, Wilbur J.

The Jungmann became popular with the flying schools of Luftsportverband, a civil flying association during the early 1930s before military flight was allowed in Germany. In reality, the association trained the pilots who formed a clandestine air arm that later became the Luftwaffe. In 1935, Carl Bücker introduced the single seat Jungmeister, so similar to the Jungman that parts could be interchanged. While the Jungmeister was designed to use either the Hirth HM 506 160-hp inline air-cooled engine or the seven-cylinder radial air-cooled Siemens Sh-14A of 160 hp, the latter engine was used almost exclusively.

A number of Jungmeisters still exist, both here and in Europe, and command high prices because of their scarcity and demonstrated maneuverability. After World War II, a limited number of the airplanes were produced near Munich, but high labor costs made them almost prohibitively expensive.

Papana made a low level inverted pass in front of the grandstands, and Hagenburg, not wishing to be outdone, repeated the maneuver at no more than a few feet above the ground.

NASA transferred a variety of wind tunnel and concept models to the Museum after settling on the final Space Shuttle design."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022647-1","title":"Indicator, Fuel Pressure, German","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d69c080f-1322-4be2-a6d6-e3b7bf5403d6","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"7-1/2cm dia. and 3-1/2cm high; brass case; white dial."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400037270-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Japanese Navy","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9ce2289c2-ef44-4797-9671-d739b82949c7","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Range 0 - 102.5 Liters, with primer pump; luminous numerals; two pressure line connectors on rear; 4 mounting holes for naval aircraft."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400044687-1","title":"Slide Rule, William J.

On Labor Day 1931, the flying club sponsored the first all-black air show held in the United States, an event that attracted an estimated 15,000 spectators. Through the efforts of the Bessie Coleman School, the number of black aviators increased dramatically despite the economic hardships of the Great Depression."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"William J. Powell used many methods to attract African Americans to the field of aviation. He made a film about a young man who wanted to be a flyer, and for two years he published the Craftsmen Aero-News, a monthly journal about black aviation. He offered scholarships with free technical training in aeronautics for black youth. He invited celebrities, such as jazz musician Duke Ellington and boxer Joe Louis, to lend their names—and their funds—to his cause."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Powell published Black Wings in 1934.

Greenamyer to the National Championship Air Races, held every September near Reno, Nevada, beginning in 1964. World War II fighters were some of the most powerful propeller-driven, piston-engine aircraft ever made, so they were ideal for the Unlimited Class, which dictated no restrictions to limit performance. Greenamyer and a team of fellow Lockheed Skunk Works employees used their engineering creativity to modify a Grumman F8F-2 Bearcat into a purpose-built air racer. Grumman designed the Bearcat late in World War II as a replacement for the F6F Hellcat Navy fighter. It was noted for its exceptional climbing ability and maneuverability. Conquest 1 featured a shorter wingspan than the production Bearcat, a special small bubble canopy, a larger propeller taken from a Douglas A-1 Skyraider, and a propeller spinner from a North American P-51H Mustang. Special high-octane gasoline, fuel additives, and putty-sealed gaps to reduce drag greatly increased its speed."},{"label":"Summary","content":"With registration number N1111L and assigned race number 1, the racer was known first as the “Greenamyer Bearcat” between 1964-1965 and 1968, and then Smirnoff after the team’s main sponsor for 1966 and 1967 before being christened Conquest I in 1969.

This project, originally not intended to support Apollo, was reconfigured in 1962 and 1963 to further the presidential mandate by mapping the surface. In addition to a powerful camera that could send photographs to Earth tracking stations, it carried three scientific experiments-selnodesy (the Lunar equivalent of geodesy), meteoroid detection, and radiation measurement. It helped to scout the lunar surface, down to one-meter resolution, and identify potential landing sites. The spacecraft allowed NASA mission planners to select the safest, but most scientifically interesting landing sites for the Apollo missions."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Managed by Langley Research Center, NASA eventually sent five Lunar Orbiters to the Moon on Atlas-Agena rockets in 1966-1967. While the returns from these spacecraft interested scientists in and of themselves, they were critical to Apollo. NASA launched the five Lunar Orbiter satellites between 10 August 1966 and 1 August 1967, all successfully achieving their objectives. In total, they mapped roughly 99 percent of the lunar surface. Lunar Orbiter 1 became the first spacecraft to take a picture of the Earth from the Moon, preempting the famous \"Earthrise\" photograph of Apollo 8 by more than two years. But this Lunar Orbiter image, for all of its significance did not have the salience of the more famous image in part because it was not full color. At the completion of the third mission, moreover, the Apollo planners announced that they had sufficient data to press on with an astronaut landing, and were able to use the last two missions for other activities. They conducted more general scientific surveys and also mapped the lunar gravitational field. For example, Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and 95 percent of the farside, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the farside coverage and acquired up to two-meter resolution images of 36 pre-selected areas."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The photographic system on board Lunar Orbiter was particularly unique. Instead of sending television pictures back to Earth as electrical signals, Lunar Orbiter took actual photographs, developed them on board, and then scanned them using a special photoelectric system.

In an attempt to compete with the superior performance of the Spad VII and the recently introduced Spad XIII, Nieuport explored the use of a more powerful motor than the types employed in the sesquiplane series. The availability of a more powerful, and heavier, 160-horsepower Gnôme rotary engine prompted the decision to increase the surface area of the lower wing to compensate for the greater weight of the new power plant, hence eliminating the typical Nieuport sesquiplane V-strut configuration."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In early 1918, the French Air Service rejected the new Nieuport design as a front-line fighter in favor of the sturdier, more advanced Spad XIII.

The Nieuport 28 performed creditably as the first operational pursuit aircraft in the fledgling U.S. Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force. Thus, the primary significance of the Nieuport 28 for the national aeronautical collection is that it was the first fighter aircraft to serve with an American fighter unit under American command and in support of U.S. troops. It was also first type to score an aerial victory with an American unit.

Twelve Nieuports, along with examples of several other European types brought back, were used by the U.S. Navy from 1919 to 1921 for shipboard launching trials. Many, often harrowing, launches were undertaken. Some of the twelve Navy Nieuport 28s were destroyed in accidents. The surviving aircraft, worn out beyond repair, were surplused after the trials.

Because of its varied and interesting role in U.S. aviation history, this aircraft has a richly deserved place in the NASM collection."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The museum's Nieuport 28 has a complex and confusing history. It was acquired in 1986 from Cole Palen, founder and operator of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome. He flew the aircraft regularly in his air shows from 1958 to 1972. Immediately before its transfer to NASM, the airplane was on loan from Palen to the Intrepid Sea/Air/Space Museum in New York."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Upon close inspection, it became clear that the NASM aircraft is a composite of several different Nieuport 28s. The various components had been owned by a number of different people and used in a variety of capacities over a long period of time. As a result, the pieces have been shuffled around a lot and re-built many times. A large number of parts were not original and in many cases the replacement parts were not prepared to original specification. As a result, a serious investigation of the history of the NASM airframe was undertaken to determine as near as possible the provenance of the museum's Nieuport 28."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When it was acquired a number of erroneous assumptions were passed on, probably uncorroborated stories from Cole Palen. Initially the aircraft was believed to have been a war-time product and that it flew with the U.S. Air Service in World War I. Additionally, it was purported to have been one of the twelve U.S. Navy Nieuports tested in 1919-1921, that it was used in the Hollywood epic \"Dawn Patrol,\" and that Howard Hughes had owned it at one point. Painstaking research has demonstrated that nearly all of these assumptions were untrue."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To determine the actual history of the NASM Nieuport, the logical place to begin was with the numbers and markings on the airframe. There are five different serial numbers on the airplane. The fuselage number on the firewall is 6497. The upper wings have a manufacturing date of February 1919 with serial numbers 7103 (left panel) and 7226 (right panel). The lower left wing panel is marked as having been fabricated in November 1918 with serial number 6465. The lower right was made in October 1918 with serial number 6432."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first obvious conclusion drawn from these data was that the NASM Nieuport 28 is essentially a postwar product. The lower wing panels were made at the very end of the war, which concluded on November 11, 1918. The fuselage serial number being higher than the lower wing numbers dates it as very late 1918 or very early 1919. The upper wings are dated 1919. Therefore, the NASM aircraft could not have been a war veteran. Further, given the late production dates, it can be concluded that the NASM aircraft must be a modified and improved postwar version of the Nieuport 28C.1, sometimes referred to as a Nieuport 28A."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"A third conclusion drawn from the serial numbers was that the components are probably from at least five different aircraft. This is not necessarily so, as wing panels, tail units, fuselages, etc., were assembled from production line manufacture. Nevertheless, given that the serial numbers are so far apart, it is hard to believe that all the present components represent one original aircraft. The upper and lower wing sets could have been originally paired together as their respective numbers are relatively close together. But the 6400 series serial numbered wings and 7000 series numbered wings were unlikely to have been on the same airframe when the airplane first left the factory. Moreover, the NASM airplane, on at least one occasion, probably more, was put together from \"best available components\" from a collection of Nieuport 28 airframes. The most reasonable interpretation based on the evidence is that the NASM Nieuport 28 is not a documented single airframe with a continuous history. It is an amalgam of component parts of several aircraft brought together many years after their original individual manufacture."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Certain that the NASM aircraft is not a war-time Nieuport, the next step was to try to determine its provenance in post-war U.S. military service. Research at the National Archives unearthed the twelve serial numbers of the aircraft tested by the U.S. Navy. None of the five numbers on the NASM Nieuport matches any of those of the Navy airplanes, definitively dispelling the belief that the aircraft was in that group. The lack of evidence on the airframe of the exclusively Navy modifications also supports the view that NASM's is not one of the twelve Navy Nieuports."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Further research demonstrated that seventy-six other Nieuport 28s were operated by the U.S. Army at various bases and fields around the country such as McCook, Mitchel, and Bolling Fields. A reasonable conclusion is that the NASM aircraft was at one of these Army facilities in the early 1920s before the airplane, as a complete airframe or component parts, found its way into private hands. Unfortunately, no records have thus far been found that place the NASM Nieuport 28, or any of its components, at any particular U.S. military post."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After the U.S. military disposed of the Nieuport 28s in its inventory in the mid-to-late-1920s, tracing more than a few of them becomes extremely difficult. Those that were not destroyed in accidents or simply junked were surplused on the open market. Private individuals scarfed them up, re-built and modified them, and used them in a wide variety of private and commercial ventures. Some were converted into air racers. Some were used in Hollywood films. Still others became air show performers and the like. Details on any particular Nieuports used in these capacities remain all but impossible to come by."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"What of the claim that the NASM aircraft participated in the making of the two Dawn Patrol films? Four original Nieuport 28s were acquired by Garland Lincoln, a war-time U.S. Air Service instructor and movie stunt pilot, for the 1930 production of Dawn Patrol. The airplanes did not fly in the film, they were only run up and taxied. Some have argued that the NASM aircraft is one of these four. At best, this can only be said of the fuselage. Several famous photographs from the production show a line-up of the four Nieuports. All four Dawn Patrol Nieuports had their wings shortened by several feet. This is quite clear in the photographs. The NASM airplane has full-span wings, at least proving that the NASM wing set was not part of any of the Dawn Patrol aircraft. The fuselage of the Nieuport is probably from one of the four Garland Lincoln airplanes used in the film. The next phase of the story points in that direction."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"At this point, the trail of the NASM Nieuport begins to emerge, faintly. Garland Lincoln sold his entire stable of airplanes, including the four original Nieuports, to Paramount Pictures in 1938. In 1941, Paramount sold the lot to United Air Services, a firm owned by movie stunt pilot, Paul Mantz, and which in 1946 became Paul Mantz Air Services. None of the Nieuport 28 airplanes that Mantz had acquired was in flying condition. Photographs taken by Don Brady in the mid-1950s at Orange County Airport show these airplanes to be disassembled and derelict. Beyond the four clipped-wing Nieuports first sold by Garland Lincoln to Paramount in 1938, Mantz apparently acquired at least one other set of original Nieuport 28 wings at some time before the parts were photographed by Brady at Orange County in the 1950s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1957, Paul Mantz traded one Nieuport 28 to James H. \"Cole\" Palen of the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, Rhinebeck, New York, for a Standard J-1. (Mantz later added approximately $200 to the trade to compensate for the Nieuport 28 being in poorer condition than the Standard J-1.) The fact that Palen's Nieuport, i.e., the NASM airplane, has full-span wings supports the belief that Mantz must have acquired more Nieuport 28 parts beyond the four clipped-wing airplanes that were in the original \"Dawn Patrol\" movie. Palen apparently selected the \"best components\" of those stored at Orange County airport to complete one aircraft. Cole Palen died in 1993, and some years earlier his home burned, destroying all his records. To confirm anything regarding his transaction with Mantz is now impossible."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The provenance of the NASM Nieuport 28 from this point on is clear. Palen completed the restoration of the aircraft to flying condition in 1958 and flew it regularly at the Old Rhinebeck Aerodrome, and at other special shows elsewhere, until he retired the airplane in 1972. It was on display at Rhinebeck for several years before being lent to the Intrepid Air/Sea/Space Museum. It was on display there until 1986 when the Nieuport was traded to NASM for an original Nieuport 10 trainer, and transported directly from the Intrepid to the museum."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This brings us back to the original question: What is the history of the NASM Nieuport 28? Based on the foregoing research, the best interpretation is that it is an assemblage of components of various aircraft that were all manufactured at the very end or soon after World War I, which almost certainly means that they were originally Nieuport 28 \"type A\" rather than standard 28C.1 parts. The components undoubtedly emanated from the seventy-six Nieuport 28s operated by the U.S. Army at numerous installations in the 1920s. Without serial numbers by location for these aircraft, it is impossible to place any of the NASM components at any specific military airfield. The period between disposal by the military and acquisition by Paul Mantz is extremely sketchy. For the most part, it can only be determined what the NASM aircraft is not, rather than what it is (e.g., that it is not one of the twelve Navy aircraft, that its wings are not from any of the four Garland Lincoln Nieuports, etc.)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Regarding the origin of the NASM Nieuport 28, all that can be said with certainty is that the airplane comprises original components that can be narrowed down only to the seventy-six post-war U.S. Army Nieuports. The circumstantial evidence that Palen received Nieuport parts from Mantz, who obtained Nieuport parts from Lincoln, tantalizingly suggests that the NASM fuselage could be from one of the Dawn Patrol aircraft. The evidence cannot support anything more definitive."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In light of the vague provenance of the NASM Nieuport, some considered judgement was required concerning the final configuration and markings of the aircraft when it was restored by the museum. One obvious possibility would have been to restore the aircraft closest to what the documentation suggests the parts represent, namely a post-war U.S. Army experimental/training aircraft. Despite the apparent common sense to that approach, there were several strong reasons not to take this route. First, there are no clues indicating at which Army installation the NASM Nieuport operated, not even a single component of the airframe. It would not only have been a pure guess which airplane it is, but total conjecture even with which airfield it was associated. Further, details on the markings of only a handful of the Army post-war aircraft exist. Painting it as one of these would only in the most remote sense represent the correct aircraft. Moreover, the Nieuport 28 type is in the national collection primarily because of its place in U.S. air operations during World War I, not because of its minor role as a post-war trainer."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Configuring it as a U.S. Navy aircraft, with the unique modifications of that use of the Nieuport 28, would have been interesting. But as it was known definitively that the NASM aircraft is not one of the Navy airplanes, and that only twelve were employed in this specialized role over a short period of time, to follow this course seemed inappropriate. For similar reasons, restoring it as one of the movie airplanes did not make sense. At best, only the fuselage of the NASM Nieuport 28 can be linked to any of the film work, and that only circumstantially. More significantly, movies represent only a small part of the Nieuport 28's history. Further, the movie Nieuports only were run up on the ground; they never actually flew in the films."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This presented the final option, which was taken: configuring the airplane as one of the war-time U.S. Air Service Nieuport 28s. Even though the NASM Nieuport is certainly not a war veteran because it was manufactured after the United States ceased to use them in combat, the best alternative was to configure the airplane in this fashion. As noted above, the main reason for inclusion of a Nieuport 28 in the NASM collection is to document the aircraft type first used by organized American units under American colors in combat. Because the history of the NASM Nieuport cannot be documented with any specificity, and certain configurations can be ruled out, the most reasonable approach was to represent the aircraft in accordance with the justified rationale for bringing it into the collection. Therefore, it was restored to a 28C.1 configuration and painted and marked as a U.S. Air Service combat Nieuport."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The particular Nieuport 28C.1 that the museum chose to represent was that of First Lieutenant James A. Meissner of the 94th Aero Squadron, U.S.A.S., a/c serial number 6144. This aircraft was chosen, rather than one of the more famous ones such as Eddie Rickenbacker's, Douglas Campbell's or Alan Winslow's, because it is representative of the famous \"hat-in-the-ring\" 94th Aero Squadron without misleading museum visitors into thinking that the NASM aircraft is actually one of the especially well-known American Nieuport 28s. Furthermore, Meissner's number 6144 has an interesting history in its own right."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On two occasions, with Meissner at the controls, 6144 experienced the infamous wing failure in a dive associated with the Nieuport 28. He landed safely both times. Meissner went on to command the 147th Aero Squadron. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross with Oak Leaf Clusters and the Croix de Guerre. He scored a total of 5 2/3 victories while flying with the 94th and the 147th. (Meissner is often credited with eight victories, but in 1969, the U.S. Air Force divided the credit of shared victories among all the pilots involved. Before this, each was given full credit for the victory in their totals. Having several shared victories, Meissner's official tally was reduced accordingly.) He survived the war, leaving the Air Service in 1919. Meissner's aircraft carried the standard factory-applied French camouflage, the famous \"hat-in-the-ring\" insignia, and standard U.S. wing and tail markings of the period, making it especially representative of the way American Nieuport 28s appeared when flown in the first U.S. air combat operations."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The airplane is painted as Meissner's appeared after May 10, 1918, after repairs from the first wing fabric shedding incident. Before this date, Meissner's Nieuport carried a black, or possibly red, number \"14\" on the fuselage sides and probably on the wings. He shot down one enemy aircraft with the airplane so marked, for which he was awarded the DSC. After May 10, the \"14\" on the fuselage was replaced with a white \"8\" with a thin black outline. A white \"8\" (with no black outline) also was applied to the top of the upper left wing of Meissner's 6144 upon repairing and re-numbering the airplane. Marked as number \"8,\" Meissner shot down three more enemy aircraft in 6144 and experienced a second wing structure failure. Number \"8\" was chosen because more photographs exist of 6144 as number \"8\" and because it flew longer with this marking."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400029400-0","title":"Pratt & Whitney Wasp Jr. R-985-AN-14B \"Dancing Engine\"","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv993a1a3c0-8d6d-4e19-b40f-9ce86dcb17b2","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Type: Reciprocating, Radial, 9 cylinders, air cooled"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Power rating: 336 kW (450 hp) at 2,300 rpm"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Displacement: 16.1 L (985 cu in)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Bore and Stroke: 132 mm (5.2in.) x 132 mm (5.2 in.)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Weight: 309 kg (682 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"Begun in 1925 by former Wright Aeronautical employees as a spinoff from a machine tool company, Pratt & Whitney became one of the world’s largest manufacturers of aircraft engines, and the Wasp Jr. is one of the most successful reciprocating engines ever built.

This airplane, known as the Wright Flyer, sometimes referred to as the Kitty Hawk Flyer, was the product of a sophisticated four-year program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in 1899. During the Wrights' design and construction of their experimental aircraft they also pioneered many of the basic tenets and techniques of modern aeronautical engineering, such as the use of a wind tunnel and flight testing as design tools. Their seminal accomplishment encompassed not only the breakthrough first flight of an airplane, but also the equally important achievement of establishing the foundation of aeronautical engineering."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Wright brothers had a passing interest in flight as youngsters. In 1878 their father gave them a toy flying helicopter model powered by strands of twisted rubber. They played and experimented with it extensively and even built several larger copies of the device. They also had some experience with kites. But not until 1896, prompted by the widely publicized fatal crash of famed glider pioneer Otto Lilienthal, did the Wrights begin serious study of flight. After absorbing what materials related to the subject the brothers had available locally, Wilbur wrote to the Smithsonian Institution on May 30, 1899, requesting any publications on aeronautics that it could offer."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Shortly after their receipt of the Smithsonian materials, the Wrights built their first aeronautical craft, a five-foot-wingspan biplane kite, in the summer of 1899. The Wrights chose to follow Lilienthal's lead of using gliders as a stepping stone towards a practical powered airplane. The 1899 kite was built as a preliminary test device to establish the viability of the control system that they planned to use in their first full-size glider. This means of control would be a central feature of the later successful powered airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rather than controlling the craft by altering the center of gravity by shifting the pilot's body weight as Lilienthal had done, the Wrights intended to balance their glider aerodynamically. They reasoned that if a wing generates lift when presented to an oncoming flow of air, producing differing amounts of lift on either end of the wing would cause one side to rise more than the other, which in turn would bank the entire aircraft. A mechanical means of inducing this differential lift would provide the pilot with effective lateral control of the airplane. The Wrights accomplished this by twisting, or warping, the tips of the wings in opposite directions via a series of lines attached to the outer edges of the wings that were manipulated by the pilot. The idea advanced aeronautical experimentation significantly because it provided an effective method of controlling an airplane in three-dimensional space and, because it was aerodynamically based, it did not limit the size of the aircraft as shifting body weight obviously did. The satisfactory performance of the 1899 kite demonstrated the practicality of the wing warping control system."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Encouraged by the success of their small wing warping kite, the brothers built and flew two full-size piloted gliders in 1900 and 1901. Beyond the issue of control, the Wrights had to grapple with developing an efficient airfoil shape and solving fundamental problems of structural design. Like the kite, these gliders were biplanes. For control of climb and descent, the gliders had forward-mounted horizontal stabilizers. Neither craft had a tail. The Wrights' home of Dayton, Ohio, did not offer suitable conditions for flying the gliders. An inquiry with the U.S. Weather Bureau identified Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with its sandy, wide-open spaces and strong, steady winds as an optimal test site. In September 1900, the Wrights made their first trip to the little fishing hamlet that they would make world famous."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Wrights primarily flew the 1900 glider as a kite, with no pilot aboard, to test its performance, but they did make a few free glides with Wilbur Wright as pilot, totaling two minutes in the air. Although the control system worked well and the structural design of the craft was sound, the lift of this, as well as their second glider in 1901, was substantially less than the Wrights' earlier calculations had predicted. They began to question seriously the aerodynamic data that they had used. Now at a critical juncture, Wilbur and Orville decided to conduct an extensive series of tests of wing shapes. They built a small wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to gather a body of accurate aerodynamic data with which to design their next glider. The heart of the Wright wind tunnel was the ingeniously designed pair of test instruments that were mounted inside. These measured coefficients of lift and drag on small model wing shapes, the terms in the equations for calculating lift and drag about which the brothers were in doubt."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Wrights' third glider, built in 1902 based on the wind tunnel experiments, was a dramatic success. The lift problems were solved, and with a few refinements to the control system (the key one being a movable vertical tail), they were able to make numerous extended controlled glides. They made between seven hundred and one thousand flights in 1902. The single best one was 191.5 m (622.5 ft) in twenty-six seconds. The brothers were now convinced that they stood at the threshold of realizing mechanical flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the spring and summer of 1903 they built their first powered airplane. Essentially a larger and sturdier version of the 1902 glider, the only fundamentally new component of the 1903 aircraft was the propulsion system. With the assistance of their bicycle shop mechanic, Charles Taylor, the Wrights built a small, twelve-horsepower gasoline engine. While the engine was a significant enough achievement, the genuinely innovative feature of the propulsion system was the propellers. The brothers conceived the propellers as rotary wings, producing a horizontal thrust force aerodynamically. By turning an airfoil section on its side and spinning it to create an air flow over the surface, the Wrights reasoned that a horizontal \"lift\" force would be generated that would propel the airplane forward. The concept was one of the most original and creative aspects of the Wrights' aeronautical work. The 1903 airplane was fitted with two propellers mounted behind the wings and connected to the engine, centrally located on the bottom wing, via a chain-and-sprocket transmission system."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By the fall of 1903, the powered airplane was ready for trial. A number of problems with the engine transmission system delayed the first flight attempt until mid-December. After winning the toss of a coin to determine which brother would make the first try, Wilbur took the pilot's position and made an unsuccessful attempt on December 14th, damaging the Flyer slightly. Repairs were completed for a second attempt on December 17. It was now Orville's turn. At 10:35 a.m. the Flyer lifted off the beach at Kitty Hawk for a twelve-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft). Three more flights were made that morning, the brothers alternating as pilot. The second and third were in the range of two hundred feet. With Wilbur at the controls, the fourth and last flight covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds.

Roll control was done through the rudder, as there were no ailerons on the wings. Altitude was controlled by an aneroid pre-set in millibars of atmospheric pressure. Maximum altitude was about 10,000 ft, but most bombs flew at only a few thousand feet. When the propeller made a set number of revolutions, a counter fired a detonator in the tail that locked the elevator in a neutral position, cut off rudder control and deployed two hinged spoilers from the underside of the tailplane, causing the missile to a dive on its target."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Theoretically, pulsejets develop thrust at zero velocity, but in practice the V-1 functioned efficiently only when it was boosted into the air.

Pressurized hydrogen peroxide caused a piston on the ramp to thrust forward, hurling the missile into the air where the pulsejet would be activated once the missile had attained an initial operational speed of 200-mph. During early test flights, before the development of the catapult, solid-fuel rocket boosters were used. The V-1 was also air-launched by modified Heinkel He 111 aircraft. The usual flight time for the V-1, which used low grade aviation gasoline, was about half an hour at altitudes of between two and three thousand feet and speeds of up to 400 mph.

His idea was a kind of pulsejet with a low pressure supercharger and sparkplug igniter. The Belgian inventor Georges Marconet applied for a Belgian patent in 1909 for a similar idea meant to be applied to aircraft and was granted French patent No. 412,478. The Frenchmen Barbazat, Lenoir, and René Lorin evolved ideas along these lines. Lorin's concepts, published in the magazine L'Aerophile in 1913 and later in his L'Air et la Vitesse (Air and Speed) (Paris, 1919), were well publicized. Lorin, who claimed his work went back to 1907, advocated the development of long-range missiles for bombarding objectives like Berlin. His designs consisted of both ram and pulsejet type devices."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Independently, in Germany, the engineer Paul Schmidt, who was familiar with Lorin's writings and who had been studying air-breath jet-propulsion since 1928, took out a patent on a type of pulsejet on 25 April 1931 (German Patent No. 523,655). He conducted experiments at the Munich-Wiesenfeld airfield under support from the Research Division of the Ministry of Transportation. Schmidt was primarily interested in pulsejets for aircraft. He constructed a motor with a duct which produced a thrust of 450 kg (1,000 lbs.) but it was destroyed after only 13 minutes of operation. Nonetheless, the inventor continued to receive support from the Transportation Ministry to 1935 and then from this organization's successor, the RLM or Air Ministry, although the work proceeded slowly. From 1935 to 1940, the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) provided additional funds, with which Schmidt established a full-time research group at Munich, with Hans Lembcke as his chief assistant. By 1941, Schmidt produced his SR 500 model; by the following year it generated 1,650 lbs. of thrust, but there were difficulties with its noise level and inefficient fuel spray arrangement."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1939, frustrated with Schmidt's slow progress, the RLM initiated a second pulsejet program at Argus Motorenwerke in Berlin under the director of Dr.-Ing. Fritz Gosslau. At first unaware of Schmidt's work, he meanwhile began the design of a similar motor. The Argus motor used a flow valve but the group soon learned of Schmidt's developments and through his cooperation in February 1940, they adopted his superior flap valves, but otherwise the Argus company pursued its own arrangement. There was no further cooperation between Schmidt and Argus, although by 1943 the V-1 pulsejet was called the Argus-Schmidtrohr, or Argus-Schmidt tube. The first successful Argus pulsejet produced a thrust of 300 kg (660 lbs.) and was sufficiently reliable. With modifications, including a fuel regulator, the thrust was increased to 350 kg (770 lbs.). Beginning in April 1941, flight tests were made on cargo gliders and other aircraft with an eye to using the pulsejet as aircraft propulsion, but ultimately the severe vibration it produced made it unusable for that purpose."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In the meantime, Gosslau had been pursuing pilotless aircraft (or what we would now call cruise missiles) since 1939, based on experiments that went back to World War I in Germany and the Allied powers. All earlier missiles had used reciprocating engines, although missiles using various forms of reaction propulsion had been discussed in Germany since at least 1934. In early 1942, Gosslau proposed to designer Dr. Robert Lusser, who had left Heinkel aircraft and was looking for a job, that they work together on a pulsejet flying bomb, and although Lusser ultimately decided to go to Fieseler Flugzeugbau (Fiesler Aircraft Construction Company) of Kassel, this collaboration came to fruition soon thereafter as an Argus-Fieseler project. V-1 development was accelerated by the British bombing of the old medieval Hanseatic city of Lübeck, which incensed Hitler; on 14 April 1942 he ordered retaliatory \"terror attacks\" against British cities other than London. Two weeks later Argus and Fieseler presented a proposal for a project Erfurt P35, which closely resembled the latter Fi 103 or V-1."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On 19 June 1942, Argus and Fieseler representatives held a meeting in the Air Ministry chaired by Field-Marshal Erhard Milch, who ordered development to go forward with the highest priority; the RLM assigned the aircraft designation Fieseler Fi 103. To insure secrecy, the missile was first designated the Kirschkern and then FZG 76, which signified a target or target-towing craft for anti-aircraft gunners. An additional reason for the high priority on the flying bomb was rivalry with the Army, which just at this time began test launches of its revolutionary, rocket-powered A-4 ballistic missile-the later V-2."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The testing of the weapon was undertaken at the joint Army-Air Force experimental station at Peenemünde, on the Baltic coast, where the A-4 was developed. First flight tests with an unpowered prototype were made in October 1942, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 dropped a missile to test glide characteristics. On 10 December the first Fi 103 flight test was made-an air launch from the Fw 200. The first ground-launch test, using a concrete ramp, was made at Peenemünde-West on 24 December in which the missile flew for sixty seconds. In later tests, ranges of 150 miles was achieved with accuracies of a half a mile, but this came only after a long and difficult series of flight tests in which a number of technical problems with the pulsejet and the Askania guidance system manifested themselves."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By late September or early October, 1943, mass production of the FZG 76 was initiated at the Volkswagen factory at Fallersleben, though the bombing of Kassel interrupted operations affecting the FZG 76 at the Fiesler works, with deliveries held up and delayed testing of modifications."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Flakregiment 155 (W) was formed and trained at Zinnowitz, near Peenemünde, to fire the missiles and 96 launch sites were begun in occupied northern France for launching the weapons across the English Channel against London and other British cities. Some of the launch sites were built as bomb-proof concrete bunkers. However, the first type of launch sites, nicknamed \"ski sites\" by the Allies because of the shape of their ramps, had to be abandoned after repeated Allied attacks, delaying deployment further. A movable and more easily concealed launch ramp was hurriedly developed in its place."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"At 4:18 a.m. on 13 June 1944, the first of four of the missiles - now called the V-1 - fell on Swanscombe, Kent, England. On 1 September, the German Flakregiment 155 (W) fired its last round of V-1's from its base on French soil against Antwerp, Belgium. Up to this time, about 9,000 V-1's, including more than 2,000 abortive missiles or misses, were fired against England. The V-1 campaign against Antwerp and other Belgian cities continued from launch sites in Germany and the Netherlands. The first air-launch of a V-1 took place on 9 July 1944, when Heinkel He 111s of III./KG 3 began attacking London. After the V-1 sites in the Pas de Calais were overrun by Allied troops at the end of August 1944, for many months the only way to attack Britain with V-1 was by air. Due to fuel shortages, exhaustion and combat losses from exploding V-1 and Allied fighters, KG 53's campaign finally ended on 14 January 1945."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 25 February, 1945, the British Air Ministry reported the Germans had a new model of the V-1 with a range of nearly 250 miles could hit London from Western Holland. On 3 March, the new V-1's were launched against London from this position. At about 10 a.m. on 29 March, the final V-1 sent toward England was downed by anti-aircraft guns at Iwade, near Sittingbourne."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The casualties for the V-1 against the United were 6,184 killed in the London area and 17,981 seriously injured. While the effects of the V-1 bombardments was heavy, effective countermeasures were developed by August 1944, anti-aircraft guns, aided by radar, searchlights, and ground spotters from the Royal Observer Corps and other organizations, as well as barrage balloons carrying cables which entangled the missiles, considerably diminished the weapon's impact. Some V-1's were also shot down by Allied planes and a few were known to have been flipped over before reaching their targets by the wingtips by intercepting fighters. Even V-1s that did get through were not very accurate."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In all 8,892 V-1 were ground-launched and about 1,600 were air-launched against Britain. By one estimate, of the 7,488 which crossed the English Channel, 3,957 were destroyed and 2,419 reached the London area. Secondary targets were Southampton, and for air-launched missiles, Manchester and Gloucester. Almost 6,200 were killed in Britain as a result of the V-1. On the European Continent, the V-1 inflicted the most casualties and damage against Antwerp, Belgium, upon which about 8,696 were fired, while 3,141 were fired against the Belgian city of Liège, and 151 against Brussels. The number of casualties inflicted by the V-1 on the Continent was 4,683 military and civilians killed plus 10,075 wounded. Of these, Antwerp sustained the most casulaties."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Under Project Reichenberg, the Germans also built a piloted, suicide version of the V-1 which was tested by diminutive pilots, including the famous Hanna Reitsch, but the Re 4 model was never placed into action due to resistance in the Nazi leadership to an explicit suicide weapon."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Before the war ended, the Americans began modifying and copying the V-1 from salvaged parts furnished to them by the British, and built more than 1,000 U.S. versions called the JB-2, and popularly known as the Thunderbug, which were to be used against both the Germans and Japanese. The Ford Motor Company made the pulsejet engines while Republic Aviation made the airframes and Willys-Overland airframe parts. None of these missiles went into combat, although they did provide missile experience to both the Army Air Forces and the Navy. The Air Forces tested many ground and air-launches of the JB-2, from October 1944 at Eglin Air Field (later AFB), Florida. The air launches were made, one under each wing, from Boeing B-17G Flying Fortresses, with plans to use them from the B-29 Superfortress. The Navy's version, designated the Loon and also KUW-1, were tested at Point Mugu, California, later fired from submarines in the Pacific."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following the war, due to the V-1, the pulsejet was also in vogue for several years as a low-cost powerplant for a variety of sub-sonic missiles and target drones in the U.S. and other countries. For example, the French Arsenal ARS 5501 was a radio-controlled ground-to-air or air-to-air drone developed by 1949 and strongly resembled the original V-1. When air-launched, the ARS 5501 was mounted and launched from an LeO 45 aircraft. Among the American pulsejet-powered craft of the post-war period are the XKD5G-1 and Katydid drones and Gorgon 2C missiles. These craft, however, were soon outmoded since they were not capable of operating at high altitudes and higher speeds."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Other V-1s on Exhibit"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The V-1 on display at the National Air and Space Museum represents one of 27 known examples of this missile.

During 1957, the Bell Helicopter Corporation modified a stock Bell H-13J helicopter to meet the President's special needs. Technicians added all-metal rotor blades, special arm and foot rests to the right seat, and a frame-less, Plexiglas nose bubble heavily tinted to reduce glare and heat.

When Igor Sikorsky won several wartime contracts to build military helicopters, Bell began to believe that one day the helicopter might become a common mode of personal transportation. Yet much work remained before he and the company could even hope to compete successfully in this potential new market. The biggest problem facing Bell and his design staff was that no one understood the aerodynamic and engineering principles of rotary winged flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1941, an enthusiastic, free-lance engineer named Arthur Young asked Bell to watch a demonstration of a remote control, flying model helicopter that Young had devoted the last decade to developing. Bell watched the model fly with remarkable stability and control. The key to this advanced performance lay in a stabilizer bar, attached to the main rotor hub, that Young had invented and patented. Bell recognized the inventor's talent immediately. He hired Young, put him to work alongside Bell's friend and engineering assistant, Bartram Kelly, and instructed the men to build a full-scale, flying prototype of Young's helicopter design. Bell named it the Model 30 (see NASM collection) and it first flew on December 18, 1942."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1945, the Model 30 demonstrator could fly and carry enough payload capacity to encourage Bell to proceed with a larger, commercial version called the Model 42. Backed by the Model 30's success and flashy styling, the Model 42 seemed destined to win production orders but it failed completely after company politics choked the design process. The senior staff at Bell resented Arthur Young's lack of formal training and ignored his inputs. This led to poor engineering decisions and shoddy quality control during production. Larry Bell also misread the market for the Model 42 and aimed the aircraft at private pilots and their families. In reality, it was commercial operators who needed the unique capabilities offered by the helicopter."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bell decided to step back and rethink his approach. He chose to refine the Model 30 design, install a more powerful engine and side-by-side seating for two, and one of the most successful helicopter designs of the twentieth century resulted. It was the first helicopter designed exclusively for the civil market rather than military customers. Bell called it the Model 47 for the year he introduced it and he sold two versions. The stylish coupe model was again aimed at private owners and again, it did not sell. The utility model hit the commercial market squarely between the eyes. It was lean and utilitarian, stripped of styling gimmicks, and ready for work. Bell enclosed the cockpit beneath a huge, unframed bubble canopy and this distinctive feature is now recognized worldwide."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The utility version sold slowly at first but by 1949, customers were buying enough Model 47s to convince Bell to develop the design further. The Air Force, which oversaw the procurement of aircraft for the Army under a Congressional directive, purchased the Bell 47 for the service under the H-13 designation. Army and Marine pilots, flying Model 47s, evacuated over 15,000 wounded personnel during the Korean War with an unprecedented death rate of less than 2 percent. Bell continued to refine the Model 47 design, based on the needs of military and commercial customers. The firm installed more powerful engines and larger fuel tanks to increase range and endurance, and lift larger payloads. Military operations in Korea and sales to the commercial oil industry kept Bell production lines moving at a brisk pace. By the first half of 1953, the company had delivered more than 1,000 Model 47s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1954, Bell started building the Model 47H, a version that weighed less than pervious models because a new stressed-skin, semi-monocoque tail boom replaced the old welded steel-tube boom. A pilot could fly the 47H about 20 percent faster than older models. The new version also carried an additional seat and a relatively spacious baggage compartment. In 1955, Bell followed up the 47H with the 47J Ranger, a version designed to appeal to the business community. The \"Ranger\" could accommodate three passengers seated on a bench behind a single pilot."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As the Cold War arms race intensified during the 1950s, the Soviet Union steadily upgraded its strategic bomber and submarine forces. United States strategists began to fear that the Soviets might launch a successful first strike using nuclear weapons. The U. S. government constructed underground command centers to protect the national leadership and allow it to maintain its authority in the event of a nuclear strike. These bunkers were located in rural areas and U. S. strategic planners conducted several exercises to test how quickly national leaders could travel from downtown Washington to command posts outside the city. During one civil defense drill, President Dwight D. Eisenhower rode in his personal limousine while cabinet members flew in a helicopter and arrived at the bunker far sooner than the president. This sobering outcome sparked the search for a suitable helicopter to whisk the Chief Executive to safety."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"President Dwight D. Eisenhower's chief pilot, Air Force Col. William G. Draper, had spent most of the President's term searching for small aircraft, including helicopters, capable of carrying the chief executive comfortably and safely to the small airport near his Gettysburg, Pennsylvania farm. However, until 1955, the Secret Service had refused to allow the President to fly in any aircraft equipped with less than four engines. While a helicopter seemed like an obvious solution, an U-4B Aero Commander served as the President's light transport until Draper could find a model that met the Secret Services stringent standards. He rejected the large Sikorsky helicopters because of the noise they produced and he also had misgivings about their safety record. He also found that earlier Model 47s, while reliable, could not carry the pilot, the President and a Secret Service agent comfortably."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Early in 1957, Draper decided that the Bell H-13J Ranger was the ideal presidential helicopter and the United States Air Force purchased two to fill this critical need.

He flew aboard a Marine Sikorsky UH-34D Seahorse helicopter (see NASM collection) for part of this journey. The passenger cabin inside the Seahorse was more than three times the size of the Bell Ranger and the President immediately recognized the advantages of flying in this much larger helicopter. The Bell could not carry aides or family members and seemed cramped even during short flights. Because the Air Force did not operate large helicopters as part of its mission, the United States Army and the Marine Corps formed detachments to provide the much more spacious UH-34 helicopters for presidential transport and the H-13Js were used for transporting other high level VIPs. Eisenhower tried to avoid favoring either service by alternating his trips between the Army and Marine helicopters. For a time, both services maintained presidential helicopter units but eventually only the Marine Corps possessed suitable aircraft, and to this day, the official Presidential helicopter is designated \"Marine One.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Air Force presidential helicopter mission ended with the Eisenhower presidency. In 1961, the Air Force relocated the H-13Js to Bolling Air Force Base across the Anacostia River from Washington, and assigned them to the 1001st Helicopter Squadron. This unit provided VIP transport to cabinet members, defense department officials, and occasionally the Vice President.

During World War II, he flew his own aircraft around the country for government contract work, and quite often he had been left at airports with unreliable or inadequate means of transportation into towns. The roadable aircraft would be flown to an airport and, with the disengagement of the wings and tail, it would become a car, capable of being driven to the final destination. Fulton designed the Airphibian as a high-wing monoplane, similar in appearance to a Stinson Voyager but with a distinctive four-wheel landing gear with fairings/fenders. It had a conventional fabric-covered steel-tube aft fuselage and empennage, straight tapered cantilever wings of metal rib and fabric construction, and a semi-monocoque forward fuselage that detached and converted into a car."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following Fulton's desire for secrecy, Army Air Force Captain Frazer Dougherty piloted the first flight of the prototype off of a remote grass strip near Middleburg, VA in the spring of 1945. Dougherty and Fulton had met at a dinner party at avation entrepeneur and engineer Grover Loening's New York home and Dougherty soon became the company test pilot. Engineers Ted Polhemus and Franz Alverez and veteran mechanic Wayne Dasher were the technical team that worked on Fulton's aerial gunnery simulator and also built the Airphiban prototype. To acquire the funding for design, certification, and production, Fulton formed Continental, Inc. at the Danbury Airport, Danbury, Connecticut."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first production prototype test flight was May 21, 1947. Ground handling was considered excellent in both the roadable and airplane configurations. Normal turning of the steering wheel provided steering on the road. The right rudder pedal provided normal brake operation, the left pedal operated the clutch, and an accelerator provided power. The engine drove the rear wheels through a torque converter, drive shaft, combined transmission and differential, and universal joints. All four wheels could be braked for ground operations; only the rear two wheels could be braked for taxiing. Normal speeds were 110 mph in the air and 55 mph on the ground."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The propeller, rear fuselage, and wings were removed for road operations. Attachment to the aircraft was accomplished by backing the car to the fuselage, leveling the tail and wings, moving three locking levers that inserted and locked large pins into fittings. The spar and tail parts slid into horizontally-inclined U-fittings. After locking into place, the two outrigger wheels that support the wings and the retractable tail wheel were cranked up into storage position. The propeller was removed from its bracket on the side of the fuselage, the prop spinner was removed, the propeller screwed on with a built-in wrench, and the spinner replaced again. The engine would not start if everything was not properly connected. The design is actually composed of seventeen different inventions."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In December 1950 the CAA approved the FA-2 with a strut-braced wing and 150 hp electric drive engine. The first production model, FA-2-101, N74153, flew in 1950. It had an Aircooled Motors 6A4150-B-3 modified engine. A cantilever wing model, the FA-3 was certificated by the CAA in June 1952 and the production model, FA-3-101, was flown shortly thereafter. This aircraft, N74154, is NASM's aircraft. Robert Fulton received an order for eight production models, to be used by CAA inspectors themselves, and they were built but not delivered. Instead, several company officers felt that that they were not getting enough of a return on their investment in the certification process, so, in 1953, they pulled out of the deal, taking the financial backing and several Airphibians with them."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1960, Joseph J.

In essence, combining aviation and automotive technology into a marketable form of transportation proved to be elusive for Fulton and Continental, as it has been for many others. Nonetheless, the Airphibian was the first aircar to receive CAA certification and only the Taylor Aerocar, which was inspired by the Airphibian, received certification as well.

In 1997 and 1998, Robert Fulton, Jr.'s son, Robert III, restored the Airphibian at the family home in Newtown, Connecticut. Robert Fulton, Jr. and his Airphibian were the centerpiece of the 1998 Louis-Vuitton Car Show at Rockefeller Center in New York City.

The U.S. Air Force, from the Korean War through the Vietnam War and beyond, used the Air Rescue System for the retrieval of personnel from covert maneuvers or crew downed in hostile territory, day and night, land and sea. Dr. William Leary’s Operation Cold Feet tells the story of this critical life saving device for deep reconnaissance missions. Before the heavy lift helicopter, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army used the Skyhook Aerial Recovery System for the retrieval of equipment and materiel. Characteristically, Fulton invented seven separate components that were integrated into one single effective system. The ingenious system was based on the inflation of a small blimp that was dropped or carried by personnel. Aircraft spotted the blimp to which was attached a nylon rope and the personnel in a harness. A wide hooking device attached to the nose of the aircraft, either an HC-130H Hercules or AC-1 Caribou, would snag the line and begin the lift and reel-in process at the back of the aircraft. Skyhook evolved into derivative retrieval systems including: Skyrange (recovery of objects in the air), Searange (recovery of items lying on the water), Seasled (high-speed recovery of quantities of persons in the water with a boat) and others."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Robert Edison Fulton was a Renaissance man whose life transcended one technology or one career. As a young man, he rode around the world on a motorcycle using a 35mm motion picture camera to document the individual cultures and societies of the inter-war years (early 1930s) and produced a film, One Man Caravan. He established the Robert Fulton Company on a hilltop in western Connecticut, complete with a grass airstrip. His home revealed his architectural talents and he also pioneered aspects of sound recording technology, electric pianos, and modern glass panes. Overall, Robert Fulton held a minimum of 70 patents. Later, in his 90s, his artistic career continued to flourish in sculpture and photography and he even had a one-man show in a New York City art gallery. He died in 2004 at age 95."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Fulton’s dream of a roadable aircraft was impossible for him to bring to reality, and it might even be considered a bit impractical, however, the idea lives on and the potential is appreciated. Meanwhile, his Fulton Skyhook system was a highly successful retrieval system that is a hidden success. Used for several decades, it nonetheless remains one of those unknown marvels of technology that do not make the headlines or are not widely marketed. The importance of the system can be attested to by those whose lives have been saved and by the operations that were completed but, unfortunately, many of these operations were covert and thus truly unknown. The Gunairstructor was an early flight simulator and a progenitor of today’s video displays and games."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"His Airphibian, though seemingly whimsical, tugs at our desire for better air and ground transportation and provides a practical starting point for future designs. His willingness to work with the military to improve and produce new systems reveals the depth of the man serving his country and using his immense imagination and technical skill for the greater good. All inventors bubble with ideas and we depend upon these ideas to improve our lives and take us to the future. His son remarked that perhaps his father’s legacy might not be understood “because he makes everything look too easy. There is no evidence of effort. There is only clear and severe application.”"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023145-0","title":"Indicator, Exhaust Gas Temperature, Japanese Army","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e9cb28d1-0fad-4a8d-92f7-71a4c731393c","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Dual selector; range 500 to 900 degrees C; electrical"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023134-1","title":"Indicator, Turn and Bank, German","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv970f502a2-f739-4a85-bfe7-6c1ad4dae798","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"80mm dia, 150mm l; luminous pointer; ball bank indicator"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400029800-0","title":"Piper J-3 Cub","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv93727de26-1277-4492-917c-e79afe7831bb","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"N35773; distinctive yellow, high-wing light monoplane with tailwheel; trainer and sport aviation; Continental A-65, 65 hp engine."},{"label":"Summary","content":"First built in 1937, the Piper J-3 earned fame as a trainer and sport plane.

So successful was it that the name \"Cub\" soon came to be a generic term for all light airplanes and it remains one of the most recognized designs in aviation."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The story of the J-3 began in the late 1920s with C. Gilbert and Gordon Taylor, partners in the very small Taylor Brothers Aircraft Company of Rochester, New York. One time barnstormers, the brothers designed and were attempting to market a two-seat monoplane called the Chummy, when Gordon Taylor was killed in a crash. Gilbert Taylor, who believed that there would be a growing market for light planes, moved in 1929 to Bradford, Pennsylvania, where community leaders were anxious to promote new local industries. The Bradford Board of Commerce provided $50,000 to capitalize the new Taylor Company, which built five Chummys before the Great Depression put a halt to construction."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"One of the stockholders was an oilman named William T. Piper. Being interested in aviation and believing that the Chummy was too expensive and inefficient, Piper offered to sponsor the development of a small plane to sell for half the Chummy's $3,985. The resulting aircraft, designated the E-2, was completed in late 1930, and fitted with a two-cylinder Brownbach \"Tiger Kitten\" engine. Testing had revealed the Tiger Kitten, which was rated at 20 hp, had too little power for the E-2. At full throttle, the small airplane was able only to indulge in 'grass cutting,\" rising a few feet into the air before settling back to earth. However, it motivated Taylor's accountant to observe that an airplane with a kitten engine should be known as a cub, and a legend was born."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1930, the Taylor Company went bankrupt, but Piper bought the assets for $761 and retained Taylor as president. The aircraft received a Continental A-40 engine and became the Taylor E-2, resulting in sales of more than 300. Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle-deck and fairing it into the trailing edge of the wing; he also rounded the wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the break down of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in December 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. Taylor J-2s were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937. Piper moved the company to an old silk factory in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania and began production again in July. In November Piper changed the company name to Piper Aircraft Company and the first Piper J-2 Cub, serial number 1937 (also in NASM's collection), rolled off the line. In all 1,547 E-2/J-2 Cubs were built from February 1931 through May of 1938."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In late 1937 Piper also introduced the J-3 Cub which did not look much different than the J-2 but featured a stronger steel tube fuselage, larger and upholstered (instead of plywood) seats, and more leg room due to the firewall being moved forward and the clean up of cables and controls throughout the cabin, along with many small improvements. Brakes were soon added too. Powered by 40-hp Continental, Lycoming, or Franklin engines, the J-3 sold for $1,300. Engine horsepower was soon raised to fifty and reached sixty-five by 1940. Piper also standardized the color scheme to Lock Haven Yellow, an orange-yellow later replaced by the lighter Piper Cub yellow with black trim."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The organization of the Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) immediately before the entry of the United States into World War II spurred sales of the J-3. In 1940, 3,016 Cubs were built and at the wartime peak a new J-3 emerged from the factory every twenty minutes. Seventy-five percent of all pilots in the CPTP were trained on Cubs, many going on to more advanced training in the military."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Cubs were also flown during the war as observation, liaison, and ambulance airplanes. Known variously as the L-4, 0-59, and NE-1, they rendered valuable service and were nicknamed \"Grasshoppers.\" By 1947, when production ended, 19,888 Piper Cubs had been built. The J-3 is now finding an ever-increasing popularity among antique airplane owners, and brand new Cubs are being constructed by homebuilders.

If he could position the Bell Aircraft Corporation to feed this market, the firm might survive the transition from war to peace. Once hostilities ceased, the government would immediately cancel contracts for the firm's military aircraft. The Bell Model 30 Ship 1A proved that a practical personal helicopter was feasible and it led directly to the Bell Model 47. This rotorcraft has remained in worldwide service longer than any other helicopter and many operators around the world continued to fly the Bell 47 in 2001."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Model 30 represents the successful gamble by Bell Aircraft Corporation founder Lawrence Bell to enter the nascent helicopter market of the mid-1940s. While this aircraft was only a demonstration prototype, its production variant, the Model 47, has managed to remain in service in one form or another longer than any other helicopter type, and some are still operating at the start of the twenty-first century. A unique pool of talent, brought together by Lawrence Bell included the helicopter pioneer, Arthur Young, and a superb engineer, Bartram Kelley, was responsible for the success of the Model 30 and its descendents."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Arthur Young’s career as a helicopter pioneer began with an intense intellectual compulsion to address the technical problems of the age. In the late 1920s, he realized that a stable, controllable helicopter was one of the few technological challenges of the time that had not shown signs of significant progress, and set about finding a solution. Young approached the development of a practical helicopter in a methodical and scientific manner that was not common practice among many of his fellow pioneers, who relied on trial and error, using full-scale aircraft. Instead, Young used inexpensive, and easily-constructed, remotely-controlled models to test the validity of his theories. This simple expedient allowed him to refine his designs rapidly, and to become recognized as a leader in solving the technical hurdles that had kept helicopter development stagnant for decades. By 1941, Young was flying 1/6-scale models that demonstrated levels of stability and control that were unprecedented in previous helicopter designs. He effectively incorporated Igor Sikorsky’s tail rotor concept, at a time when most helicopter pioneers viewed it as impractical."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Young’s most innovative design feature was to incorporate a stabilizer bar on the rotor mast perpendicular to the rotor blades. This counterbalance system caused the rotor to teeter when the airframe of the helicopter moved in response to turbulence, or control inputs, and dampened further oscillation. This feature allowed an unprecedented level of stability. Other designers were still using hinges to create rotor stability, but those designs relied on a significant lag time in rotor response, which Young had revealed in his experiments to be minimal."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Meanwhile, Lawrence Bell had come to the conclusion that, after the war ended, Americans would begin to rely on personal aircraft for personal and that the helicopter offered the most practical means to achieve it. He realized that the military contracts that had sustained his business thus far would dry up as soon as peace was declared, and that his company’s only hope for continued survival was to find a product for which there would be a great deal of commercial demand. However, Bell had no experience with helicopter design and was looking for someone with a workable concept, when he was introduced to Arthur Young. Bell was immediately impressed with Young’s latest flying model, and they quickly came to an agreement for construction of two full-scale aircraft. The first helicopter was to be a single-seat demonstration aircraft, followed by a two-seat version."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By June 1942 construction had begun on Young’s first full-scale prototype, known as the Model 30 Ship 1. The rollout was a mere six months later. The airframe consisted of a steel tube structure with a specially manufactured magnesium tail boom. Rotor blades were made of a wooden laminate with a metal spar leading edge and balsa filler in the trailing edge. The 160 hp Franklin motor was mounted vertically, which was an improvement over earlier Sikorsky models that required additional weight-consuming gearing for their horizontally mounted engines. Landing gear initially consisted of four spider-like skids. Larry Bell wanted the flight controls to be more like those of an automobile than an airplane, thus the collective pitch lever moved side to side as a replacement for rudder pedals that were likely to be mishandled by novice private pilots who were used to automobile pedals. This feature was later abandoned when it became apparent that the configuration pioneered by Sikorsky would be the industry standard."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Shortly after Ship 1’s first flight on December 29, 1942, the tail boom was destroyed in a crash. It was replaced by an open inverted triangular steel-tube truss that would later become a hallmark of the Model 47. The design team then traded the skid landing gear for a conventional tricycle undercarriage. The tail was destroyed for a second time in a September 1943 crash. At this point Ship 2 had been almost completed and took up the testing slack while Ship 1 was repaired. Upon completion of its repairs, a newly designated Ship 1A rolled out of the shop wearing a new magnesium-skin tail, as well as a strengthened rotor system and landing gear. Ship 1A flew in a series of public demonstrations designed to generate public enthusiasm for the new form of aerial transport, while Young and his workers completed a third Model 30 variant. Ship 3 was a three-seat no-frills version that took full advantage of the lessons learned on the two earlier models. On one occasion, this design flew with seven people on board, most of whom were hanging off the side. This demonstration dramatically the improvements that had been made over the Sikorsky R-4 and R-6 series that could barely lift two people."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By war’s end, Bell was ready to begin production of a new design, designated the Model 42. This luxury sedan of the skies proved to be a dismal failure. While Young and Kelley were working on theoretical studies, Bell’s production engineers, whose experience was limited to airplanes, worked on the design of the Model 42. Their inexperience resulted in an unreliable and under-powered aircraft that was priced well beyond the reach of most private citizens. The only hope for Bell’s future in the helicopter industry was to put the Model 30 Ship 3 into production as a military and commercial utility helicopter. This decision resulted in the Model 47, which became the world’s first commercially certified helicopter on March 8, 1946."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Ironically, the same military contracts that Larry Bell did not want to depend on in the post-war marketplace were the salvation of the company’s financial success, and established it as a leading helicopter manufacturer. The superb Model 47 did not fare much better than the Model 42 when it first appeared, largely because the value of the helicopter to the business community had not been established by Bell and other manufacturers, who had instead focused their efforts on private users. As the military’s Sikorsky R-6s began to wear out, a search began for a new liaison and light medevac helicopter. The Model 47 was chosen over the similar Hiller Model 360, and a short time later, established a sterling reputation as a flying ambulance in Korea. After the Model 47 gained notoriety in Korea and in demonstrations of industrial applications, the type became an outstanding success, with a total of 5,000 sold to military and commercial users."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After its useful days had ended, the Model 30 Ship 1 was donated to the Franklin Institute. In 1964, on the 20th Anniversary of the American Helicopter Society, it was given to the Smithsonian Institution along with the Piasecki PV-2 (see NASM collection). The stability and smooth handling of the Model 30 and its successors were qualities that were essential if the helicopter was to establish a niche in the civil market. The unique combination of Arthur Young’s inventive genius and Bell’s marketing skills created a product that quickly transformed an experimental category of aircraft into a safe, and reliable machine with unprecedented utility. After the creation of the Model 30, helicopter development was not left to individual dreamers, but was embraced by many of the giants in the aviation industry as an essential element in maintaining their position in the aviation industry."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rotor Diameter: 9.98 m (32 ft 9 in)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Length: 8.19 m (26 ft 10.5 in)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Height: 2.62 m (8 ft 7 in)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Weight: Empty, 521.6 kg (1150 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gross, 737.1 kg (1625 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Engine: Franklin Model O-298, 165 hp (takeoff power)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"155 hp (maximum continuous)"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022871-1","title":"Model, Static, Ellehammer II","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9b74de337-ec25-41b3-831b-9bd1a33e2f1e","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Wood and cloth exhibit model of the 1906 Ellehammer II aircraft in red frame with natural covering color scheme. 1/14 scale."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400024421-0","title":"Binoculars, Friendship 7","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv908238acb-2fa3-43f1-90df-caf0069ddd20","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"Astronaut John Glenn Jr. carried these binoculars, manufactured by Hensoldt-Wetzlar, into space during the during the flight of Friendship 7, the first U.S. orbital flight carrying a human on February 20, 1962."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400043237-0","title":"Suit, SpaceShipOne, Mike Melvill","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d99e9f94-d161-42c0-a8c2-032ea7e69b48","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"Test pilot Mike Melvill wore this suit on June 21, 2004, during the first privately funded spaceflight of SpaceShipOne.

During the late 1940s, helicopter pioneers began to experiment with alternative propulsion methods that did not require heavy components such as tail rotor assemblies, drive shafts, main rotor clutches, transmissions, and engine cooling blowers. Without these items, a helicopter's useful load increases by a significant margin. These components are also potential failure points, making helicopters more fragile and more difficult to maintain. Yet another advantage is the substantial reduction in the cost to produce helicopters without this equipment. In 1948, Stanley Hiller began to experiment with ramjets mounted on the tips of the main rotor blade. He hoped to make small, ramjet-powered helicopters practical and affordable, and to eventually design and sell giant aerial cranes propelled by ramjets or jet turbine engines. The Hiller HOE-1 became the first production ramjet helicopter, and the Army and Navy flew a small number of these aircraft for a short time to test and evaluate the technology."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller XHOE-1"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Helicopter lifting capacity is limited in large part by the weight of components such as tail rotor assemblies, clutches, transmissions, and cooling blowers.

Modern helicopters have been able to reduce some components necessary to piston engines through the use of gas turbines. In 1948, turbine engines of a size suitable for the small airframe of a helicopter had not been proven reliable to the degree that a manufacturer would be willing to attempt production of such an aircraft. Helicopter pioneer Stanley Hiller, and a number of enterprising competitors employed an alternative solution by using rotor tip mounted ramjets to power a small compact helicopter that demonstrated the technologies he hoped to use in the design of giant aerial cranes. Hiller's design became the first production helicopter to be powered by ramjets, and entered limited military service with both the Army and Navy as a technology demonstrator."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Stanley Hiller established himself as a leading contender in the nascent helicopter market of the 1940s with the development of his Model 360, which saw military service through the Korean War as the UH-12/H-23.

Hiller had begun experimenting with tip-jet technology in 1945, as a means of simplifying the increasingly complex and heavy mechanisms necessary for vertical flight. Tip-jet technology originated in World War Two with Baron Friedrich von Doblhoff, an Austrian who developed and flew several practical models. Doblhoff's \"cold-cycle\" tip-jet rotors used high-pressure air from a compressor that was ducted through the rotor blades to their tips to power the blades around at a sufficient rpm to generate lift. Hiller's experimentation initially revealed that a \"hot-cycle\" system, which used exhaust gases and an afterburner type arrangement at the exhaust ducts, created greater efficiency and thrust. However, it did not take Hiller long to recognize that the greatest weight savings, and propulsive efficiency could be gained, by mounting the engines directly onto the tips of the rotor blades."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller began to develop his vision for giant flying cranes, utilizing tip-mounted ramjets or jet turbines, by developing a simple version that could be sold as an affordable aircraft for the masses that was small, lightweight, easy to fly and maintain, transportable, and above all else, cheap. In 1948, Hiller began work on the HJ-1 Hornet single-seat sport helicopter. The most difficult challenge was developing the ramjet engines, which had seen very little practical use, but were far easier to engineer than jet turbines. The ramjet uses a shaped pipe in a high-speed airflow and the combustion of large quantities of fuel to create a significant pressure differential that produces thrust. The ramjet accomplishes the same effect as a turbine engine but without any moving parts, which results in a considerably lighter and more reliable structure. The disadvantages are that a high-speed airflow must already be established before the ramjet can begin to operate, and the fuel consumption goes well beyond that of a turbine engine. Hiller used the well-established pulse jet design from the German V-1 flying bomb as a starting point, but quickly discarded it in favor of a pure ramjet. A year later, Hiller perfected a ramjet engine that weighed only 5 kg (11 lb.) and put out 14 kg (31 lb.) of thrust when the rotor tip was moving at a maximum operational speed 207 m/sec (680 ft/sec) at 550 rpm. Since the two bladed rotor of the Hornet had one ramjet mounted on each tip a total of approximately 27 kg (60 lb.) of thrust was produced. This does not seem like much, but the only mass that the engines had to move was their own weight in addition to the small, lightweight rotor blades, for which this thrust was more than adequate. Since the rotor was freewheeling, there wasn't any torque that required a tail rotor. The high speed airflow required to start the ramjets was achieved through the use of a small 50 horsepower motor that spun the rotor up to 150 rpm at which point the airflow was sufficient to sustain the operation of the ramjets. Ignition of the fuel, which could be gasoline, kerosene, or fuel oil, was accomplished through the use of a device, similar to a glow plug, referred to as a \"flame-holder,\" which insured re-ignition if the ramjet flamed out."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first single-seat HJ-1, referred to as the utility model, consisted of an open steel and aluminum tube frame that used a rudder for directional control. This design first flew in 1950. The next HJ-1 enclosed the pilot and passenger sitting side-by-side in a cabin made of fiberglass, which was one of the first applications of this new material in the aviation industry. Hiller used this aircraft to begin his marketing campaign for the design while the aircraft was undergoing certification tests with the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). The third HJ-1, which was the version intended for mass production at a price of $5,000, contained a number of changes. On the first two aircraft, the collective could be moved side-to-side to control the rudder in place of pedals. The new design used rudder pedals to control a small tail rotor. The tail rotor was an asymmetric design that consisted of a single blade balanced by a counterweight, and was driven by the starter motor. The cockpit was also significantly enlarged to accommodate two passengers. These changes increased the weight from 356 lb. to 510 lb., while decreasing the service ceiling to less than 7,000'. Stability of the design was excellent because of the incorporation of Hiller's patented Rotor-Matic servo control system, which allowed the aircraft to maintain a hover with hands off the cyclic. The Hornet series was one of the first helicopter designs to use all-metal rotor blades, which had not been used before that time because previously poor metallurgy often caused structural failure with the rapid flexing that rotor blades experience in flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Korean War began before the new HJ-1 configuration could be successfully marketed. Hiller's limited production capacity was quickly taken up by military orders for his UH-12/H-23, and the HJ-1 program was halted. In 1952, Hiller talked the Navy into purchasing three HJ-1s under the HOE-1 designation, as a possible answer to a Marine Corps request for a flying ultralight vehicle. The Army, which had fallen well behind the Marine Corps in the use of helicopters, was not about to be left out of another project, and placed an order for two HJ-1s under the YH-32 designation. One improvement was retrofitted to the aircraft after they were ordered by the military. The tail boom was extended and two downward canted horizontal stabilizers were installed to improve stability in forward flight. The first HOE-1/YH-32s were not ready for delivery until late 1954, because Hiller was certificating the aircraft to Civil Aviation Authority standards as opposed to military specifications. The Army saw the aircraft as a possible low-cost replacement for its jeep in certain liaison, wire laying, and observation roles, and ordered an additional dozen for extensive field trails, after receiving its first two."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The HOE-1 proved to have a number of operational problems that precluded its deployment in the field. The small helicopter could not be safely approached while the rotors were turning since they hung close to the ground. The lightweight construction of the helicopter meant that it could easily be blown off balance in moderate wind conditions. The flames coming out of the ramjets produced an incredibly bright white halo when the HOE-1 was flown at night. This was a considerable disadvantage in the military environment, and the effect prompted a number of UFO sightings when operated in the vicinity of populated areas. The noise generated by the ramjets was also quite considerable, and did not endear the United Helicopter's Palo Alto, California facility to its neighbors. The most serious limitation was the enormous fuel burn of the ramjets, which consumed fuel at approximately ten times the rate of a piston engine providing the same power output. The fuel capacity of the HOE-1/YH-32 was only 136 kg (300 lb.) This had to supply a full power fuel burn of nearly 272 (600 lb.) per hour, which led to a maximum endurance of just over thirty minutes including start-up and shut down. The never exceed airspeed of the helicopter was mere 62 knots, which resulted in a maximum range of less than 30 nautical miles. Hiller appreciated the limitations of the aircraft, but believed the design concept would prove itself once reliable turbine engines could be found to replace of ramjets. However, the centrifugal fuel pumps required for turbines, which would be subjected to several thousand times the force of gravity, needed considerable reengineering before they could reliably be used for a tip-jet design."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The HOE-1/YH-32's most worrisome problem was its flight characteristics during autorotation in the event of engine failure. The ramjets created considerable drag on the rotors when they were not running, which necessitated a rapid descent to keep the rotors windmilling at a sufficient rpm to prevent an unrecoverable rotor stall. The rate of descent required during autorotation was nearly 3,000 fpm, which was almost twice that of most other helicopters. Additionally, because the ramjets increased the rotational inertia of the blades to a high degree relative to the weight of the aircraft, the flare into landing out of the autorotation had to be initiated much earlier and more gradually than was done in other helicopters. Flaring out of autorotation usually occurred below 100' in most other types, but this aircraft required a flare to begin between 200' and 300' above ground."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Army and Navy did not employ the HOE-1/YH-32s operationally, but did utilize them in some interesting tests. The effective employment of helicopters into forward combat zones during the Korean War sparked some interest in arming helicopters to provide fire support. Previously the U.S. Air Force had jealously guarded its air support role, and had prevented the Army from pursuing the development of armed helicopters. As the Korean War was ending, the restrictions placed on arming Army aircraft by the National Security Act of 1947 and the subsequent Key-West accords were easing. In 1955, the Army issued its first ever contract for an armed helicopter when it negotiated with United Helicopters to produce two YH-32A ULVs (Ultralight Vehicles). These were bare-bones YH-32s that had their cockpit fairings removed, and the tail rotor replaced by a twin tail boom arrangement that mounted small rudders. The ULVs were nicknamed the \"Sally Rand,\" a well-known burlesque star, because of their stripped down configuration. These three-seat variants were used in 1957 at Fort Rucker, Alabama to test the employment of a wide variety of weapons, including missiles, rockets, and recoilless rifles. The blast of the recoilless rifles had necessitated the change from the tail rotor to rudders. These tests were successful, and proved the viability of the helicopter as a stable weapons platform. However, the performance limitations of the YH-32A did not allow the aircraft to progress beyond its status as a technology demonstrator, and the ULV project was the type's swan song."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller's skycrane concept never progressed beyond the design stage. Hughes Aircraft constructed a large turbine powered lifting helicopter, the XH-17, which utilized Doblhoff's principles, but was too inefficient to warrant further development. In the early 1960s, the Army began a competition for the development of a heavy lift helicopter. Hiller responded to the challenge, but the competition was canceled before the design could progress off the drawing board. Hiller later approached NASA to develop a concept for a giant ramjet helicopter in the 1,000,000 lb. class to capture spent Saturn V stages as they parachuted to earth. NASA eventually decided that a reusable space shuttle was a more effective way of overcoming the economic burden of throwaway rockets than trying to catch spent rockets in mid-air with a giant helicopter. Ironically, by this time, Hiller had finally succeeded in overcoming the engineering difficulties in designing reliable tip-jet turbine engines, which would have made such projects feasible. He would not get another chance to develop the technology, before he left his company during the controversial loss of the Army's Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) contract to Hughes aircraft. The remnants of his company began a project to replace the ramjets on one of the old HOE-1s with turbojets, but the company closed its doors before this project was completed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Several Hornets and HOE-1/YH-32As survive in the hands of museums and collectors. The aircraft in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum is the second HOE-1 to be completed. The aircraft was accepted by the Navy on December 27, 1955 and completed a mere 28.5 hours of flight testing through March 1957 at the U.S. Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. Most of this aircraft's flights were short hops under twenty minutes in length. Apparently, some of the HOE-1/YH-32As that have fallen into collector's hands may have managed a few further flights with their new owners, though the type was never certificated for civil operations, because of the difficult autorotation technique required. However, the 8RJ2b ramjet was actually approved for civil use during Hiller's attempts to get the HJ-1 certificated. The 1950s saw a number of attempts by other manufacturers to employ ramjets or other tip-jet propulsion to helicopters. Many of these designs flew successfully, but most were ultimately abandoned because of the same limitations encountered by the Hiller Hornet."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The fuel consumption, and noise created by ramjets, and other tip-jet designs, have precluded their use in more recent helicopter designs in spite of their considerable advantages. The goal of the affordable personal helicopter continues to be an elusive goal.

These groups wanted an aircraft with a low wing-loading that pilots and students could easily operate from small airfields. They also preferred an airplane constructed from aluminum. Wooden gliders were too fragile to store outside and the cost to hangar them was usually beyond the financial means of these modest flyers. The brothers believed that a new glider must be easier to fly than the thousands of wooden, military surplus, training gliders beginning to flood the civilian market. A glider that flew well and easily, they reasoned, would keep new pilots enthusiastic about flying. Franklin E.

The 2-22 stalled at 43 km/h (27 mph), cruised at 48 km/h (30 mph) and a pilot could fly it as fast as 143 km/h (89 mph). Sales were very slow for more than a decade but the company eventually sold 257 units before production ended in 1967.

Total wing surface area was slightly less than standard Rogallo models, but the aspect ratio (wingspan to wing chord ratio) increased substantially. The first Phoenix hang gliders flew with a long fantail, a device thought to improve stability. As Bennett continued to develop the Phoenix series, he increased the leading-edge convergence angle even further, and removed the fantail after flight experience showed that it did not increase stability. The docile handling characteristics and good stability of the Phoenix VI made it a popular trainer at hang glider flying schools. More experienced pilots also favored this model type because it flew relatively fast, had good rough air penetration and handling characteristics, and the glider could soar on updrafts far better than earlier standard Rogallo designs.

This built-in auto-recovery mode helped pilots recover safely from high-speed dives. The VI.B also used wing tip battens arranged in a radial pattern. This technique made the tips stiffer, reducing drag and improving roll response. The keel of the 'VI.B was shortened and Bennett added additional battens that extended all the way from the wing leading edge to the trailing edge. With these modifications, performance improved at low and high speeds."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bill Bennett's Phoenix series of hang gliders is part of the second generation of late twentieth century hang glider designs.

His work helped to grow the sport during the 1970s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Australian John Dickenson gets too little credit for his monumental breakthrough to invent the technology that allowed pilots to precisely control a hang glider. Early in 1963, the Grafton Water Ski Club in New South Wales, Australia, asked Dickenson to build a kite for an upcoming water ski festival. Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite. He made and tested models of a Rogallo-type wing and they showed improved stability, but control was little better than the classic ski kite."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Since Lilienthal’s first flights in 1891, pilots had clung to their hang gliders framework and tried to influence the direction of flight by swinging their legs and body to shift their weight in the direction they wanted to go. Their range of movement was limited because the pilot was positioned at the center of the wing. Control was feeble at best."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While swinging his daughter sideways on a swing set in 1963, Dickenson had the flash of insight that gave pilots precise control and transformed the hang glider. Dickenson’s idea was brilliant and simple, and added little weight. It consisted of a control bar and a seat or harness suspended from the keel tube by a strap. He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips. From the hanging strap positioned just behind the control bar, he suspended the pilot’s seat. The strap supported the pilot like a pendulum and allowed him or her to shift their weight with ease beneath the wing, pushing and pulling the control bar to make the glider climb, dive, or turn."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Dickenson tested the controls on a half-size flexible Rogallo-type wing too small to fly. The tests were promising so Dickenson built a kite large enough to lift a person. On September 8, 1963, as John Dickenson looked on, a ski boat towed his friend Rod Fuller aloft for the first flight of a Rogallo-type wing ski kite with the improved Dickenson control system. By 1966, Dickenson was selling his adaptation of the Rogallo-type wing ski kite fitted with his new control system, and in 1967, he introduced fellow Australian Bill Bennett to the booming sport of flying ski-kites. Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name. The excitement of flying and the ease of access to flight provided by the Rogallo-type wing with Dickenson control appealed to the freewheeling sport leisure culture of the late 1960s, and across America, Bennett's kites grew in popularity."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1973 and 1974, Bennett and his designers experimented with variations on the standard Rogallo wing, and then used what they learned to design a new line of hang gliders called the Phoenix series. Bennett increased the leading-edge convergence angle from 80 to more than 95 degrees. This change reduced the sweep angle of the wing and increased the span. This reduced the wing surface area but increased the aspect ratio (wingspan to wing chord). Bennett also added a longer keel tube called a fantail, a feature thought to improve stability. As Bennett continued to develop the Phoenix gliders, he increased the leading-edge convergence angle even further and removed the fantail after flight experience showed that it did not increase stability."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By January 1975, Bennett and chief designer Richard Boone had completed the Phoenix IV. This variant used more rounded wing tips to improve the glider’s stability, but the modification made the glider more difficult to turn and reduced stability in turbulent air. Bennett and Boone solved this problem when they introduced the Phoenix VI. They made pockets in the sail to hold metal tubes called battens. The battens curved up slightly at the wing trailing edge to reduce the wing angle of attack at the wing tips. This design feature reduced stall speed and helped prevent one wing tip from stalling, a condition that could result in loss of control. Batten tips also kept the center of lift point closer to the center of gravity, improving overall control of the glider."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The docile handling characteristics and good stability of the Phoenix VI made it a popular trainer at hang glider flying schools.

About 7 km (4.5 mi) out he developed magneto trouble, and the airplane was forced down in a field, barely missing a windmill. When the wheels touched the ground they dug deep into the mud left by the earlier rains. The airplane was brought to an abrupt halt, breaking a landing skid. With good foresight, Wiseman had a chase car following him and the ground crew removed the airplane from the mud, repaired the engine problems, and readied the machine for takeoff. By the time they were ready, stiff winds came up and the team decided to delay completion of the fight until the next day."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the ground still soft the following morning, a canvas cover that was used to protect the airplane from dampness was spread out on the ground to form a makeshift runway.

In a letter dated April 9, 1948, Garber reported to the Oakland airport authorities on the progress that had been made on the expansion of the NAM and inquired if the heirs of the builders of the aircraft would consent to turning them over to the Smithsonian Institution. The families enthusiastically agreed. On May 31, 1948, at a ceremony at Oakland airport commemorating the twentieth anniversary of Charles Kingsford-Smith's flight to Australia in the Southern Cross, the Black Diamond and Wiseman aircraft were transferred to the National Air Museum.

Air tactics for airship-based missions were developed during these patrol flights. After the airship launched the Sparrowhawks from its internal hangar, the fighters would simulate attacks against the airships while gunners on board would \"fire\" back with gun cameras. As airborne scouts, two Sparrowhawks would fly abreast of the dirigible, reporting various sightings by radio."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When the scouting mission was concluded, the airships accelerated to full speed, which was slightly above the Sparrowhawk's stalling speed. This provided a sufficient margin of maneuvering speed for the Sparrowhawks as they approached for the recovery operation.

While still in Chicago, he secured financial backing from the Armour Company, a local firm which was then introducing a new grape-flavored soft drink called Vin Fiz. Armour provided a special train, emblazoned with the Vin Fiz logo, with cars for the accommodation of Rodgers's family and his support crew, and a \"hangar\" car, which was a rolling workshop, filled with spare parts to repair and maintain the airplane over the course of the flight. There was even an automobile on board to pick up Rodgers after forced landings away from the rail line. The pilot would receive five dollars for every mile he flew east of the Mississippi River and four dollars for every mile west of the river. Rodgers agreed to pay for the fuel, oil, spare parts, his mechanics, and the airplane itself, which the Wright Company agreed to build. Chief mechanic on the flight was Charles Taylor, who had worked for the Wright brothers since 1901 and had built the engine for the Wright Flyer, the world's first airplane that flew at Kitty Hawk in 1903."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The airplane was a Wright EX, a special design that was used for exhibition flying, which was a slightly smaller version of the Wright Company's standard Model B flyer. Like the support rail car, Rodgers's aircraft carried the Vin Fiz logo on its wings and tail, and was quickly dubbed the Wright EX Vin Fiz. It was powered by a 35-horsepower, Wright vertical four-cylinder engine, and it carried enough fuel for a maximum of 3½ hours flying time."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rodgers began his epic journey from Sheepshead Bay, New York, on September 17, 1911. The flight was punctuated by numerous stops, delays, and accidents. When the 30-day time limit Hearst imposed for the $50,000 prize had expired, he had only reached Kansas City, Missouri. Undaunted, Rodgers continued on, determined to make the first transcontinental airplane flight whether he received the money or not. Upon leaving Kansas City, he flew due south to Texas, and then made his way across the southern U.S. border toward Pasadena, California, the official termination point of the flight. Rodgers continued to experience frequent mechanical failures, damage to the airplane in hard landings, and weather delays. Trouble arose again on November 3, shortly after passing over Imperial Junction, California, less than 320 km (200 mi) from the finish. At 1,200 m (4,000 ft), an engine cylinder exploded, damaging one of the wings and driving steel shards into Rodgers's right arm. He struggled to regain control of the Vin Fiz and, amazingly, managed to glide the 10 km (6 mi) back to Imperial Junction and land safely. The engine and airplane were repaired a day later, and despite his painful injury, Rodgers departed for Pasadena once again on November 4. Further engine problems forced him down in Banning, California, about half way to his final destination. On November 5 he was airborne again, and after brief stops in Beaumont and Pomona, he arrived in Pasadena to a hero's welcome, 49 days after setting out from Sheepshead Bay."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although Pasadena was the official end of the coast-to-coast journey, Rodgers wanted to fly all the way to the Pacific shore to complete the flight. Several coastal towns bid for the honor, and Long Beach was the final selection. They agreed to pay Rodgers $1,000, plus part of the gate receipts of an exhibition of the Vin Fiz after arrival. Rodgers took off from Pasadena for the short 37 km (23 mi) trip to Long Beach on November 12. Minutes into the flight, engine failure forced him down near Covina Junction. Repairs to a broken fuel line had him back in the air that afternoon. But again, just a short time after takeoff, near Compton, California, Rodgers was down. This time it was a serious crash. The airplane was severely damaged and Rodgers was badly hurt. It took several weeks to make the Vin Fiz airworthy again and for Rodgers to recover from his injuries. On December 10, yet needing crutches to move about on his still healing ankle, Rodgers boarded his battered aircraft, determined to fly the Vin Fiz all the way to the Pacific Ocean. As at Pasadena, Rodgers's arrival was an organized public event and a large crowd gathered at Long Beach to welcome him. The remainder of the great adventure met without incident and Rodgers landed to cheering crowds. To create a photo opportunity for the press and the spectators the Vin Fiz was rolled into the surf, allowing the Pacific to lap over it wheels. The 6,914 km (4,321 mi) were covered in 82 hours, 4 minutes, total flying time at an average speed of 82.4 kph (51.5 mph). Cal Rodgers had secured his place in aviation history. (Robert Fowler began another west-to-east transcontinental flight on October 19, this time taking a southern route to avoid the mountains. He arrived in Jacksonville, Florida, on February 8, 1912, completing the trip in more than twice as many days as Rodgers.)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rodgers and his wife liked Pasadena and decided to stay. He kept the Vin Fiz and a second airplane, a two-seat Wright Model B, at nearby Dominguez Field. He made exhibition flights with the Vin Fiz and took up passengers and gave flight instruction with the Model B. He later moved the airplanes to Long Beach and operated from there. On April 3, 1912, Rodgers was airborne in the Model B, making a test flight after some tuning of the engine in preparation for another passenger ride. Witnesses observed a steep dive as Rodgers apparently attempted to avoid a flock of seagulls. In the next instant he was seen struggling with the controls just before the airplane crashed into the surf, only one hundred yards from his landing spot after the last leg of the transcontinental flight in December. Rodgers was killed instantly. Various causes for the accident were put forth, ranging from a seagull jamming the controls to Rodgers's recklessness or carelessness as a pilot. The precise cause remains undetermined. The wreckage of Rodgers's Model B was acquired by one of his mechanics, Frank Shaffer, and his partner Jesse Brabazon. They rebuilt it and flew for approximately one year until it was destroyed in a crash while being piloted by Brabazon's friend, Andrew Drew, who was killed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Vin Fiz was acquired after Cal's death by his cousin, Lt. John Rodgers, USN. He offered it to the Smithsonian Institution, but it was not accepted on the grounds that it was very similar to the recently acquired Wright Military Flyer. It then passed to Rodgers's wife, Mabel, who, not long after Cal's death, married Charles Wiggin. They exhibited and flew the Vin Fiz publicly for two years, until Rodgers's mother was awarded possession of the airplane in 1914 in a court ruling regarding Cal's estate. The history of the airplane becomes somewhat murky at this point. According to Charles Taylor, the Wright mechanic who assisted Rodgers on the transcontinental flight, Rodgers's mother shipped the Vin Fiz to the Wright factory in Dayton, Ohio, for refurbishment. Either unable or unwilling to pay for the work, she allowed the airplane to languish at the Wright factory and it was destroyed in 1916 after the company was sold. But this version of events is at odds with the fact that Rodgers's mother had the Vin Fiz restored and donated it to the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1917. The airplane was later acquired by the Smithsonian from Carnegie in 1934."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The probable explanation for the conflicting information lies in the misconception that there was a single Vin Fiz airframe. On the transcontinental flight, several sets of wings and a large supply of other components and spare parts were brought along on the support train. Rodgers's airplane was repaired and rebuilt many times during the trip. By the time the wheels of the Vin Fiz were rolled into the Pacific at Long Beach, almost nothing of the airplane that took off from Sheepshead Bay remained. As a result, at the end of the journey, there were enough flown, genuine Vin Fiz parts to make up more than one airplane. Charles Taylor was probably accurate when he stated that the Vin Fiz sent to the Wright factory (i.e., the intact airplane that Mabel and Charles Wiggin flew in 1912-14) was destroyed. The airplane that ended up at the Carnegie Institute, and then the Smithsonian, was very likely reconstructed from the parts left over from the many repairs and rebuilds during the flight. Thus, the airplane in the NASM collection is genuine in that it is comprised of components that, at various points, were part of the Vin Fiz during the historic coast-to-coast flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When on display at the Carnegie Institute, the engine mounted on the Vin Fiz was a wooden mock-up. The whereabouts of the original engine are unknown. At the Smithsonian, an original Wright engine of the correct type, but not associated with the flight nor with Rodgers, was put on the airplane. In 1960, the Smithsonian fully restored the Vin Fiz. In 1996, when it was part of a traveling Smithsonian exhibition, a new wooden mock-up engine was made and placed on the airplane. This was done to reduce potential wear and tear on the artifact caused by repeated removal of the heavy, original engine during assembly and disassembly of the airplane on the many stops of the exhibition tour. The mock-up engine remains on the Vin Fiz."},{"label":"Alternate Name","content":"Wright EX Vin Fiz"},{"label":"Key Accomplishment(s)","content":"First Crossing of the United States by Airplane"},{"label":"Brief Description","content":"In 1911, Calbraith Perry Rodgers was first to fly across the U.S. in this Wright EX biplane.

This world distance record generated publicity that broadcast the superiority of laminar-flow airfoils similar to those first employed on the World War II P-51 Mustang (see NASM collection) but with one crucial difference. Where the Mustang airfoil performed best at high speeds, the RJ-5 wing used a laminar-flow profile tailored specifically to operate most efficiently at low speeds. Harlan Ross had built this wing and Richard Johnson refined it, under guidance from Dr. August Raspet at the Mississippi State University. The success of the RJ-5 marked the beginning of a fundamental shift in the design philosophy of high-performance sailplanes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"A year after Johnson's flight in the RJ-5, Leonard A. Niemi started developing the Sisu 1. Neimi had spent four years learning the aircraft mechanics trade while attending a technical high school in Buffalo, New York, followed by another 6 years working for the Bell Aircraft Corporation and the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Airplane Division. After a stint in the U. S. Army, Niemi attended the University of Michigan and earned a B. S. in Aeronautical Engineering. He also spent four years performing stress analysis at Bell Helicopter. It is not clear why Niemi chose to name his design the Sisu but it is a popular Finnish word with no precise English equivalent. The term describes a fundamental characteristic of native Finns, their strength, perseverance, and backbone. Aini Rajanen, wrote in \"Of Finnish Ways\" (Barnes & Noble Books: New York, 1984) that Sisu is \"a word that can't be [directly] translated. … Sisu refers not to the courage of optimism, but to a concept of life that says, 'I may not win, but I will give up my life gladly for what I believe.' … Sisu is the only word for the Finns' strongest national characteristic.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Niemi's Sisu flew on laminar-flow wings and he designed it for private pilots to construct at home. The first flight in 1958 was so successful that Neimi decided not to sell plans or kits for the homebuilders but to modify the design for production as a finished, ready-to-fly sailplane. He changed the designation to Sisu 1A and lightened the wing structure, added vents to the dive brakes, and introduced slotted flaps to expand the low-speed performance envelope even further. Niemi also increased slightly the area of the vee-tail, elevator/rudder to compensate for increased pitch force from the new slotted flaps, and increased the deflection range of the rudder too. Niemi also introduced the 'plate-stringer' wing structure on the inboard wing sections to reduce weight without compromising the rigidity of the smooth, laminar-flow surface contours. The designer also increased the size of the dive brakes, and lengthened and widened the cockpit to hold bigger pilots."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To manufacture the Sisu, Nemi set up the Arlington Aircraft Company in the city of the same name located about halfway between Dallas and Ft. Worth, Texas. Construction began on the first four sailplanes in 1960. Pilots quickly snapped up these aircraft but production costs surpassed profits and Neimi had to sell the project to Philip J. Baugh, a retired Air Force pilot and soaring enthusiast from Charlotte, North Carolina. Baugh and Niemi moved the factory to Greenville, South Carolina, in 1963 and the firm became the Sisu Division of the Astro Corporation. Clifton McClure III managed Astro and he and Baugh wisely decided to keep Neimi on as project engineer. McClure was governor of the South Carolina division of the Soaring Society of America. He intended to carry through with Niemi's original plan for the Sisu and obtain Federal Aviation Administration type certification for the design but the daunting costs of such work forced him to abandon the effort. Baugh generously underwrote production of six more Sisus but profits never covered expenditures and metal smiths and technicians finished the tenth and last Sisu 1A in 1965."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Niemi paid careful attention to eliminating parasite drag when he conceived the Sisu. He opted for a vee-tail, retractable tow hook and main wheel, and swept-forward wings shaped to a 653418 laminar-flow airfoil. The wingtips leaned ahead of the inner wing sections to insure that the ailerons, hinged just inboard of each wingtip, continued to bite the air and provide the pilot control during a stall. Washout, twisting the wingtips to reduce slightly their angle of attack and lower their stall speed, is a much more common technique but Neimi eschewed it. Twisting the wings, however slightly, would have generated unacceptable drag. The wing surfaces had to be extremely smooth to maintain laminar-flow over a broad speed range and the designer took great care in this area. Neimi used an aluminum plate stringer technique covered with relatively thick, aluminum wing skins to prevent even the slightest buckle. Before applying finish paint, craftsmen checked the wing closely for minute imperfections, covered these depressions with filler paste, and sanded the patch smooth."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This obsession with a smooth finish enthralled one soaring pilot to remark that at \"first glance one may wonder and doubt the claimed [Sisu] performance figures.

Initial reports that a Soviet surface-to-air missile downed Powers' airplane jump-started the development of reconnaissance UAVs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Mounting bulky camera equipment to the UAV airframe without making it considerably larger and easier to target with anti-aircraft weapons became the most difficult technical hurdle. The U.S. Air Force developed the AQM-34 Firebee and flew this aircraft extensively during the Vietnam War. A small jet-turbine engine propelled the swept-wing Firebee on reconnaissance missions over North Vietnam and China."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Israel invested heavily in remotely piloted aircraft technology during the late 1960s after the Egyptians badly surprised Israeli aircrews during the short but intense Six-Day War in early June 1967. When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, Israel Aircraft Industries, Ltd., (IAI) was manufacturing the Scout UAV. Successes flying the Scout during the invasion and subsequent flight demonstrations of this UAV's capabilities convinced leaders in the U.S. Navy Mediterranean Fleet to acquire their own Scouts. Reports suggest that the suicide bombing that killed 241 U. S. Marines in Beirut in 1983 also spurred Navy officials to investigate reconnaissance UAVs. In 1984, IAI and Tadiran, Ltd., formed a joint subsidiary company called Mazlat Ltd., to develop an improved version of the Scout known as the Pioneer. The following year, Mazlat flew the Pioneer in a UAV competition sponsored by the Navy. Pacific Aerosystem's Heron 26 UAV competed against the Pioneer for a lucrative Navy contract. Pioneer won and the Navy selected AAI Corporation in the United States to build this UAV."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"A Pioneer airframe consists of a twin-tail boom fuselage with two vertical stabilizers on the tail and a conventional wing and stub fuselage mounting a pusher engine. The fixed, tricycle landing gear uses small inflatable main wheel tires but the nose gear has a castering, solid plastic wheel. The airframe consists of carbon-fiber composites, fiberglass, Kevlar, aluminum, and balsa wood. These lightweight materials enable the Pioneer to loft its payload of surveillance equipment with a 26 horsepower, two-cycle engine. The non-metallic composites also reduce the UAV's radar cross-section. A fuel capacity of 47 liters (12 gal) of 100-octane aviation gasoline can keep the Pioneer airborne for 5.5 hours."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Two operators flew a Pioneer manually from a Ground Control Station (GCS), or the airplane could fly autonomously using an on-board autopilot preprogrammed to follow a specific flight path. A ground-based Tracking Control Unit (TCU) was required to maintain a communication data link with the aircraft and monitored its position. The range of the transmitter was 185 km (115 miles). The data link was jam resistant but operators could switch to a backup mode if the primary frequency was successfully jammed. IAI also developed a Portable Control Station (PCS) for the Pioneer system. Several small, man-portable loads comprised the PCS. This allowed soldiers on the battlefield to assume control once the air vehicle was in flight. Another handy bit of avionics, the Remote Receiving Station (RRS) consisted of a small box with video display that allowed commanders to remotely view real-time imagery transmitted from the Pioneer but independent of the video link to the GCS. A fully equipped Pioneer reconnaissance unit typically consisted of five UAVs and one each GCS, TCU, and PCS, plus four RRS boxes and launch and recovery gear."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Two people could easily assemble and knockdown the Pioneer in the field. The fuselage, wings, empennage, and tail-booms detach easily and fit within a purpose-built container that protects these components during transport or prolonged storage. Once assembled, ground crews could launch the Pioneer using several methods. When launching from all but the smallest ships, a launch platform held the UAV in take-off position until an operator ignited a small, solid-fuel rocket motor to propel the aircraft to sufficient flying speed. The rocket burned out and fell away a few seconds after liftoff. Runway takeoffs also require the boost rocket or a truck-mounted pneumatic catapult. Without a steerable nosewheel, a normal runway takeoff is not possible."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To recover the UAV, operators usually fly it into a large net. The airplane also carries a tail-hook to catch an arresting wire strung across a runway. A Pioneer can carry up to 45.4 kg (100 lb) of surveillance equipment including high resolution, black-and-white television, infrared, or color cameras plus to an array of sensor packages for chemical and radiological monitoring, or for gathering electronic intelligence."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"U.S. Navy forces received their first Pioneers in June 1986, the initial part of an $87.7 million purchase of 72 Pioneers and support equipment. Fleet Composite Squadron Six (VC-6) broke-in the new UAVs at the Patuxent River Naval Air Test Center in Maryland. In December 1986, five Pioneers went aboard the battleship \"U.S.S. Iowa\" to demonstrate their ability to extend the eyes of Navy gunners. The \"Iowa's\" 41-cm (16-inch) main gun battery could hit targets beyond a range of 38 km (24 miles). During tests, four Pioneers were lost, three of them during attempts to recover the aircraft using the net. Continuing losses during flight and recovery prompted a $50 million expenditure to improve the system. Landing was particularly difficult because operators were attempting to fly the Pioneer into a small target at a precise airspeed, altitude, and angle-of-attack, without benefit of the visual, tactile, aural cues available to conventional pilots."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1987, the U. S. Marine Corps began fielding the Pioneer. The U.S. Army also experimented with UAVs during the 1980s. The Army's Aquila UAV cost nearly a billion dollars to build and test but the program failed to reach design goals and Army leaders terminated the project, and then evaluated the Pioneer. By 1990, Army units were operating this UAV. The next year, AAI formed a new subsidiary called Pioneer UAV, Inc., to exclusively manufacture the Pioneer, provide user support, and continue to refine the aircraft. The new company was required because American forces were flying hundreds of Pioneers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Saddam Hussein's military incursion into Kuwait in 1991 provided the ideal proving ground for Pioneer UAV units to prove their worth. About 40 U. S. Navy, Marine, and Army Pioneers flew more than 300 missions during Operation Desert Storm. The Navy flew Pioneers from the battleships \"Iowa\" and \"Wisconsin\" and three Marine Corps Remotely Piloted Vehicle (RPV) companies used their Pioneers to identify targets for marine artillery units and to correct their shot. The Army also deployed one UAV platoon to aid army artillery in the same manner as the Marine UAV units."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Navy Pioneers conducted 71 missions and flew a total of 232 hours during the conflict. These aircraft allowed their operators to detect, and helped vector forces to intercept, two Iraqi high-speed patrol boats menacing the fleet. They also became the eyes of naval gunners who successfully bombarded Faylaka Island. It was during this bombardment that the international media spotlight fell on the Pioneer. Crewmen aboard the battleship \"Wisconsin\" launched a Pioneer, Air Vehicle number 159, to conduct battle damage assessment after shells from the \"Missouri's\" massive 41-cm (16-inch) guns. As operators flew the Pioneer low over Faylaka Island, a number of Iraqis realized the battleship was probably preparing to fire another volley. They waved white surrender flags as the UAV passed overhead. U. S. Marines landed and collected the waiting prisoners. This event marked the first time that humans had surrendered to a robot in combat. When Navy officials offered to transfer a Pioneer to the Smithsonian Institution, curators at the National Air and Space Museum specifically asked for the UAV that Iraquis troops surrendered to during the Gulf War."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Marine Corps UAV operators completed 196 Pioneer sorties and logged 606 flight hours, including missions performed during the buildup to Operation Desert Storm. The Navy and Marine Corps lost 12 Pioneers during Desert Storm: one to hostile fire, another when it ran out of fuel while following a convoy of mobile SCUD missile launchers. Combat operations were not associated with the remaining losses. These losses included control difficulties, recovery mishaps, and one Pioneer that crashed after it accidentally flew through the wake turbulence from a passing Lockheed C-130 Hercules transport (see NASM collection). Enemy gunfire damaged three Pioneers and routine operational events damaged another 15 UAVs. U. S. Army Pioneers carried out 46 missions and logged 155 hours of flight time without losing a single aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The high non-combat loss rate prompted a negative review by the U. S. General Accounting Office. Other government watchdog groups also attacked the Pioneer operations because of alleged laxness in monitoring parts procurement. To military leaders, the Pioneer proved invaluable, even with a high loss rate. The aircraft saved many military men and women who might otherwise have died because of exposure to enemy fire. The price of a single Pioneer, $850,000, is also several orders of magnitude less than the cost of a manned reconnaissance aircraft. In 1995, Pioneer UAV Inc. began developing a Common Automatic Recovery System (CARS) to allow automated recovery at land and sea. CARS could dramatically reduce the number of recovery accidents and expand the air vehicle's adverse weather performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Pioneer continued to operate throughout the 1990s in most major U.S. military operations, including Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo. Flying over the former Yugoslavia, Pioneer operators spotted targets for Standoff Land Attack Missiles launched from Lockheed P-3 Orions aircraft. Pioneers have also helped carry out extensive surveillance during drug interdiction operations. During the late 1990s, this classs of slow and low flying UAV became increasingly vulnerable to anti-aircraft gunfire, particularly in flight over Kosovo. Army units traded in their Pioneers for a larger and more advanced model called the Hunter. Until the Navy and Marine Corps phase out the Pioneer (now called Outrider), this robust airplane will remain in service."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The U. S.

Military oders soon overshadowed commercial production as the Army acquired them under the OH-58A designation to overcome production shortfalls and cost over runs in the OH-6s desperately needed in Vietnam. Though not as durable or maneuverable as the OH-6, the OH-58's advantages in reliability and maintainability associated with Bell's trademark two-bladed teetering main rotor made it a mainstay in the final years of conflict in Southeast Asia and ultimately led to its superseding its earlier competitor in scout and light attack role up to the present day.

In reality, for much of the 1970s and '80s, the JetRanger and LongRanger were the dominant helicopter models in North America for VIP transport, natural resource exploitation, film and television production, and law enforcement. By the 1990s, stagnation in the offshore market and an influx of European competitors began to limit Bell's domination of the light turbine utility helicopter market and the company responded first a four-bladed version (Model 407), and then with twin-engine (Model 427) and instrument certified (Model 429) versions. In 2010, Bell announced the production termination of the venerable JetRanger in favor of these more robust models, and in the process, acceded the lower end of the commercial market to relative newcomer Robinson [see NASM collection]."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Determined to beat Australian adventurer Dick Smith's solo attempt in JetRanger to fly the first helicopter around the world, H.

However, Smith, with limited funds, undertook his adventure in stages and did not complete his flight until the following year. Perot and Coburn, with massive logistical support, including the positioning of a container ship as a refueling point in the northern Pacific, completed their voyage in 29 days, 3 hours, and 8 minutes. For the trip, the LongRanger had full navigation equipment, survival gear and emergency items, pop-out floats, and a 151-gallon auxiliary fuel tank in place of the rear seat. The additional five-hour endurance enabled the Spirit of Texas to fly eight hours without refueling. The trip took 246.5 flight hrs at an average ground speed of 117 mph.

Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle deck and fairing it into the trainling edge of the wing; he also rounded wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the breakdown of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. About 695 Taylor J-2s Piper were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937. Piper moved the company to an old silk factory in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and began production again in July. By November the aircraft name changed to Piper.

New plans were set for the plane that Blair had renamed Excalibur Ill, from the Excalibur Flying Boat that he flew for American Export Airlines during World War II. After careful preparations, Blair flew his Mustang from New York to London on January 31, 1951, in 7 hours, 48 minutes, breaking the existing speed record by 1 hour and 7 minutes.

Norway, with Excalibur Ill on May 29, 1951. heading north over the ice and snow to Fairbanks, Alaska, via the North Pole. There were no intermediate emergency landing points and no communications or radio navigation aids available to him after departing Norway. Exactly as planned, 10 hours and 27 minutes after takeoff on the other side of the world, Excalibur Ill arrived at Fairbanks. Blair financed the project and was solely responsible for every detail of the flight. For this accomplishment, he was awarded the Harmon International Trophy in 1952 by President Harry Truman.

There was almost no private ownership during the decade following World War I for the open-cockpit biplanes had to work to earn their keep. Even the barnstormer's Jenny-despite inexpensive price and romantic images-was strictly a commercial venture that bore little resemblance to the luxury of owning an automobile. By the late 1920s and early 1930s, aircraft manufacturers began to cater to the lucrative but limited market of the wealthy sportsman pilot. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris in the Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis heightened public awareness of the airplane, but, ironically, it was the depression that further promoted the emergence of light airplanes by making larger aircraft too expensive to operate. These factors, and advances in airframe and engine technology, set the stage for one of the most significant trends in aviation between the wars when it became possible for a significant segment of American society to own and fly an airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first C-2s that Aeronca demonstrated at aviation expositions around the country won enthusiastic acceptance during the latter half of 1930. Squat and bug-eyed, the diminutive Aeronca C-2 was a simple airplane with modest performance and delightful flying characteristics. Its steel-tube fuselage and wooden wings were covered with fabric and braced with wires. The pilot, seated before a stick and rudder bar, had just four instruments: oil temperature, oil pressure, nonsensitive altimeter, and tachometer. The single-seat C-2 was powered by a two-cylinder Aeronca E-107 engine rated at 26-30 hp. In 1929, the Aeronca C-2 sold for $1,495. By mid-1930, the price had dropped to $1,245 as a result of the depression. C-2s were economical at 1 cent a mile for oil and gas, and they could often be rented for just $4.00 an hour. Furthermore, they were simple to fly, easy to maintain, and had no bad characteristics to spring on a novice pilot. By 1931, more than 100 C-2s had been sold and Aeronca introduced the two-seat C-3, with an Aeronca E-1 13 36-40 hp engine. With seating for two side-by-side, the C-3 offered greater utility than the C-2 and quickly became popular as a trainer. \"Airknockers\" or \"Flying Bathtubs, as they were affectionately known, made it possible for the average person to fly. Other light aircraft began to appear but the Aeronca style remained popular and C-3 production ended in 1937 with more than 500 produced built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"NX626N flew for ten years with a variety of owners.

During 1923 and 1924, Stearman and Beech worked at the Swallow Aeroplane Manufacturing Company as chief designer and vice president/test pilot respectively. The Swallow aircraft met with success, but Stearman and Beech lobbied to try a design with a steel tube, instead of wood, framework. When management declined, Stearman, Beech, and William Snook left Swallow to start their own company, and brought in Clyde Cessna, a successful farmer who liked to build airplanes. They incorporated the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in January 1925 and immediately designed a three-place, open-cockpit, fabric-covered biplane with a Curtiss OX-5 90 hp engine. Stearman had the steel for the tubing tested to his satisfaction at the Agronomy Department at Kansas State Agricultural College, as there were no aviation standards yet in place. Steel tubing braced the cockpit and steel wires braced the fabric-covered spruce spar wings and ribs. Steel was also used for the rudder and elevator leading and trailing edges, and the horizontal stabilizer leading edge, while the vertical stabilizer was spruce. Spruce strips were used to fair the outside of the fuselage and the turtledeck was spruce. Beech wanted redundant control cables running from the cockpit back to two elevators control horns. The landing gear was a standard duralumin speader bar between vees with bungee shockcords."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Travel Air #1 had a striking look with its fully enclosed cowling for the OX-5 engine, balanced ailerons on the upper wing that overlapped around the edge of the wing, and a blue fuselage with silver wings. Ira Beach made the first test flight on March 13, 1925. Travel Airs performed well in the 1925 Ford Reliability Tour and National Air Transport purchased a Model B for its airmail contract work. OX-5 A and B models became Model 2000s in March 1928 with ATC number 30. The Wright J-4 and J-5, significant radial engines that dramatically improved the performance and reliability of aircraft, were then offered on the airframe and, after 1928, those aircraft became the Model 4000. The 4000 found popularity with better performance and versatility through a wide variety of engine, wing, passenger seat, and landing gear combinations. The Speed wing, for example, was a shorter wing with a new airfoil that made the aircraft faster and required a recertification of the airplane to a D-4000. Ted Wells, later the designer of Beech's Staggerwing, owned the first D-4000 that also sported the first NACA cowl built by Travel Air. By early 1927, both Stearman and Cessna had left Travel Air, leaving Walter Beech in charge, and the newest Travel Air was a cabin monoplane.

N434N received the Speed wings and J-6-7 engine in 1930 and was recertificated as a D4D. Andy Stinis, of the Skywriting Corporation of America, purchased the aircraft in 1931 and flew it out of Floyd Bennett Field, Long Island, New York."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Skywriting, defined as the process of writing a name or message with smoke from an aircraft against a blue sky, began in England after World War I, the brainchild of Major John C. Savage, RAF. His first successful demonstration was at the Derby at Epsom Downs, in May 1922, when Captain Cyril Turner wrote \"Daily Mail\" above the track. Turner then came to the United States in October 1922 and wrote \"Hello U.S.A.\" above New York City. Allan J. Cameron, along with Leroy Van Patten established the Skywriting Corporation of America at Curtiss Field, an American branch of the Savage's original company. They acquired the patents for mixing the writing gas the United States, and, although it was nothing more than light oil fed through the exhaust system, they controlled the market for years. In 1923, using the Skywriting Corporation, the American Tobacco Company launched the first and very successful skywriting advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes. Pepsi-Cola Corporation became one of the longest-running contractors of skywriting; in the late 1930s and mid 1940s, it contracted or owned a total of 14 aircraft. In 1940 alone, it contracted for 2,225 writings over 48 states. Andy Stinis flew for Pepsi-Cola from 1931 to 1953."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1973 Alan Pottasch and Jack Strayer of Pepsi began a search for old skywriters and found N434N still with Andy Stinis. They intended to display it at the Pepsi corporate headquarters in Purchase, New York, however, Strayer, a former skywriter, soon persuaded Pepsi to install navigation and communications equipment and tour it once again. In 1977, Strayer hired Peggy Davies as a second pilot and then, in 1980, when Davies became a Pepsi corporate pilot, Strayer hired Suzanne Asbury. Pepsi also gave the aircraft a bright red, white, and blue paint scheme. Strayer died in 1981 and, in 1982, Steve Oliver joined Asbury as a second pilot for the Pepsi aircraft fleet that included N434P, another 1929 Travel Air. In 2000, Suzanne and Steve Oliver suggested that the aircraft should be retired for safety's sake, and Pepsi-Cola Company donated it to the National Air and Space Museum.

The prototype first flew on May 22, 1946 in Toronto. DeHavilland of Canada produced 218 Chipmunks and de Havilland in England produced 1000 airplanes for training at various Royal Air Force and University Air Squadrons during the late 1940s and into the 1950s. OGMA in Portugal produced 60 for the Portuguese Air Force. (One source says 66.) In 1952, His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh took his initial flight training in a Chipmunk. It was also used in other roles, such as light communications flights in Germany and for internal security duties on the island of Cyprus."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Chipmunk was an all-metal, low wing, tandem two-place, single engine airplane with a conventional tail wheel landing gear.

He purchased the two-place DHC-1A, N114V, first and it now resides in the Experimental Aircraft Association's museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. In 1968, Scholl bought another DHC-1A and began extensive modifications that resulted in almost a completely new aircraft. He covered over one cockpit to reconfigure the aircraft into a single-place aircraft and installed a (fuel injected) 260 hp Lycoming GO-435 flat-opposed 6-cylinder engine. He removed 20 inches from each wingtip and changed the airfoil section of the tip area. The reduction in span led to the need to lengthen the ailerons inboard to retain control effectiveness. This in turn reduced the flaps to where they became somewhat ineffective, and, since the flaps really were not required for the normal show and aerobatic routines, he removed them as a weight saving measure. These modifications improved the low speed tip stall characteristics and improved roll performance during aerobatic maneuvers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The vertical fin and rudder acquired a 25% increase in area and an increased rudder throw to manage the effects of increased engine torque and for better directional control during slow-speed aerobatic routines. The standard fixed landing gear was replaced with a retractable gear from a Bellanca airplane. The landing gear was subsequently damaged during a belly landing and resulted in a permanent wheel toe-in that was never repaired. This caused a tire drag during takeoffs and landings that led to the need for tire replacement after about 10 takeoffs and landings. Other idiosyncrasies were the pitot static tube being fashioned from a golf club shaft and a 3-inch extension added to the cockpit control stick to ease the control loads during the more severe aerobatic routines. Scholl also installed rear-view mirrors on both sides of the cowling just forward of the windscreen. He placed an RAF placard on the instrument panel as a memorial to some Vulcan bomber crew members who were his personal friends. He installed three smoke generators with red, white, and blue smoke for his show routines that included the Lomcevak tumbling/tailslide maneuver."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Scholl also referred to this plane as a Super Chipmunk, a term also used for a few other highly-modified Chipmunks.

He was also a three-time member of the U.S. Aerobatic Team, an air racer (placing several times at the National Air Races at Reno), an airshow pilot, and a fixed base operator with a school of international aerobatics. In 1959, Scholl began working for legendary Hollywood pilots Frank Tallman and Paul Mantz at Tallmantz Aviation and then later formed his own movie production company, producing and performing aerial photography and stunts for many movies and television shows.

The motorcycle used direct drive because a conventional chain-and-belt transmission could not withstand the power of the Curtiss V-8. The motor was mounted with the crankshaft running lengthwise and was connected to the drive shaft with a double universal joint. A large bevel gear on this shaft meshed with a similar one on the rear wheel."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The engine had two carburetors, each one supplying four of the eight cylinders on each side. There was no choke. The transmission was direct drive, with no clutch. The F-type cylinders were cast of special hard gray iron that was very durable. They were carefully ground and lapped to ensure near perfect compression. The cylinders were set at 90 degrees and were of two-piece design. They had a bore of 3 5/8 inches and the stroke was 3 1/4 inches. The head and pistons were also cast iron. The crankcase was of aluminum. Each of the pistons was fitted with four rings. The intake valves were automatic, atmospheric operated. The exhaust valve was push rod-operated from the camshaft. Curtiss used strong forged alloy steel for the internal components. The individual thin-wall cylinders and the head were attached to the crankcase with high tensile nickel alloy steel studs, contributing to the better-than-average lightness of the overall engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Jump spark ignition was used, energized by dry cell batteries. Lubrication was achieved by a splash system. The oil tank was located in front of the seat, holding approximately one liter (one quart) of oil. Fuel capacity was approximately 9.5 liters (2.5 gallons)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Curtiss took the motorcycle to the Florida Speed Carnival at Ormond Beach in January 1907 to make a run with the V-8. The judges agreed upon a two-mile run to get up to speed, one mile for the actual test, and two miles to stop the motorcycle. The machine's braking system was minimal, looking like something that would be found on a geared bicycle. It was a hinged paddle device on the rear tire, which did not permit a quick stop. Tom Baldwin and \"Tank\" Waters, who traveled with Curtiss, positioned themselves on either side of the machine and pushed the motorcycle until the engine started. Curtiss recorded a speed of 218 kph (136 mph) during the run. He was dubbed \"the fastest man on Earth.\""}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022792-1","title":"Indicator, Coolant Temperature","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv914d9011c-a7c5-4a2b-b988-fc82e2bf6b86","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"80mm diameter; 3-1/8in. dial; used with resistance bulb; 24v."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022511-0","title":"G-Meter / Accelerometer, Experimental, Kollsman","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv920bf011c-f858-418f-8097-12ebed130805","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"80mm diameter, 90mm long; modified by nbs to damp motion in 1941."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022693-1","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Hydrostatic","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9ff5659a5-4fba-4f81-93ae-e2684b9f336f","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Range 0 to 300 liters; with primer pump."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022798-1","title":"Pitot Tube","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv96b70c6bd-077a-4261-be62-1a8ebbc2182c","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"6.5in. long; 2 tubes; 3/16in. diameter; brass mount, copper tubes, nickel-plate."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023134-0","title":"Indicator, Synchronizer, Engine, Japanese Army, Type-100","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9b5f54ab8-a2ca-48f9-96f4-375b48be7bfd","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"50mm dia;black with white markings;panel-mounted; electric"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023571-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Japanese Navy, Tank 2","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv947c2cc2e-0e58-42c1-8d59-cd327ace1349","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Face diameter 80mm; black with white figures; primer pump and 2-hose connectors."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022766-1","title":"Statoscope","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv980cfb547-6120-4845-8052-94ac2488a6b7","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"White case with brown leather strap; 18 x 12cm"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022809-0","title":"Pitot Tube","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9b6ab3cc0-531b-490f-9071-58ac70bc5a33","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"250mm long, 125 mm high; brass plated; 1/2in. diameter."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023141-1","title":"Tachometer, Japanese Navy, Model-2, Modification-2, Dual,","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv901d66bf8-bd63-4a25-8c4e-08373f7a08b2","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Panel-mounted; range 400-3500, vertical-rea"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023559-0","title":"Indicator, ADI Pressure, Japanese Navy","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d409f515-e546-47ed-8e99-7b46b95b50fa","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"60mm diameter; range 0 to 3; white on black face; 1 fitting."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022261-1","title":"Model, Static, Wright \"R\", 1910","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv940a1fd4f-c5d1-4b82-8c9a-54de262521fc","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Wood display model of the Wright R biplane aircraft in overall silver color scheme. 1/16 scale."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400026991-1","title":"Boeing T50-BO-8A (502-10VC) Turboshaft Engine","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9bbcc2de6-ead1-4db5-8653-41ed6ed795ab","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Type: Turboshaft"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Power Rating: 224 kW (300 hp) at 28,380 rpm"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Compressor: Single-stage centrifugal"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Combustor: 2 combustion chambers"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Turbine: Single-stage axial"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Weight: 152 kg (334 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"In the mid-1940s, Boeing engineers conducted research to become familiar with gas turbines, but it became apparent that the research engines were significant in themselves.

The Jenny, as it was affectionately called, appeared in 1917. Heretofore having only produced pusher aircraft, Glenn Curtiss hired an experienced European designer to lead the new project named B. Douglas Thomas, who had worked for Avro and Sopwith in England. The Jenny performed admirably as a trainer for the U.S. Air Service during World War I, but its more significant role in aviation history was as a barnstorming and mail-carrying airplane in the 1920s. Large numbers of relatively inexpensive war surplus Jennys were available in the United States after 1918. Its affordability, ease of operation, and versatility made the Jenny the signature airplane of the barnstorming era. The Smithsonian acquired this Jenny in 1918 directly from the U.S. War Department. It is one of the finest remaining examples of this truly classic airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"One of the most famous of all aircraft is the Curtiss JN-4D, popularly known as the Jenny. More than ninety percent of American pilots trained during the First World War received their primary instruction on the Jenny. After the war, thousands of these aircraft were sold at surplus prices on the civilian market."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Jenny, powered by the equally famous Curtiss OX-5 engine, became the principal aircraft flown by barnstormers during the postwar period. Americans, particularly in rural areas, thrilled to the antics of these pilots performing in the aerial circuses that toured the country during the 1920s. For many, the Jenny would be the first airplane that they would see close-up, and those with a few dollars in hand and their fear in check, typically would make their first flight in a Jenny."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Curtiss JN series began as a hybrid design in 1914, incorporating the better features of the Model N designed in America by Glenn Curtiss and the Model J designed in England by a young engineer named B. Douglas Thomas. Thomas had been employed as an assistant chief engineer with Sopwith Aviation when Curtiss met him on a trip to England. Impressed with Thomas' aeronautical knowledge, Curtiss hired him and commissioned him to design a two-seat, tractor airplane around the Curtiss-built OX-5 engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Thomas' Model J and Curtiss' Model N were both entered in the U.S. Army evaluation trials in September 1914. Curtiss received an order in December 1914 for eight modified Model Js. Curtiss added the letter N to the designation because the modified Model J incorporated significant features of his Model N. The designation officially became the JN-2. In March 1915, Curtiss began construction of a 110,000-square-foot factory in Buffalo, New York. This factory ultimately produced Jennys at the rate of 100 per month."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The First Aero Squadron of the U.S. Air Service, Signal Corps, began receiving JN-2s in early 1915. Some of these aircraft were deployed to Mexico one year later where they performed the first tactical operations for the fledgling U.S. Air Service in the campaign against Pancho Villa."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The JN-2s had equal span wings with four strut-connected ailerons controlled by a shoulder yoke located in the rear cockpit, much like that found on Curtiss' early pusher designs. The performance of the JN-2 was less than satisfactory, so Curtiss improved the design with the substitution of unequal span wings (like the original modified Model J), and ailerons on the upper wings only with a wheel to control them in place of the outmoded yoke system. In addition, a foot bar was installed to control the rudder."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The improved design was designated the JN-3, and this model caught the interest of British authorities who were then seeking primary trainers for the Royal Naval Air Service. In order to meet this and anticipated future British wartime requirements, Curtiss built a production plant in Toronto, Canada. With a few further revisions, the airplane appeared as the JN-4 in mid 1916. JN-4s were acquired by the British as trainers and several were also supplied to the U.S. Air Service, as well as to Curtiss flying schools and private owners. A total of 701 were built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The JN-4 was quickly followed by the JN-4A, which incorporated several significant changes. It had larger and redesigned tail surfaces to increase directional stability, a revised fuselage introducing significant down thrust to the OX-5 engine, increased dihedral, and ailerons on both wings to improve lateral control. Six hundred and one JN-4As of a total of 781 built were delivered to the U.S. Air Service. The rest went to the Royal Flying Corps, the Royal Naval Air Service, and a few to the U.S. Navy."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Canadian-built Jennys, derived from the earlier JN-3 model, incorporated certain features requested by Canadian authorities. These included a control stick instead of a wheel, a revised tail, and strut-connected ailerons on both wings. This model, which first flew in January 1917, became known as the JN-4(Can), or more popularly, the Canuck. The Curtiss plant in Toronto that had been building JN-3s for the British was taken over by the Canadian government in December 1916, and reformed as Canadian Aeroplanes, Ltd."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Curtiss continued the process of evolutionary design changes to the JN-4. The JN-4B (actually an earlier design than the JN-4A) saw some success in the civilian market, as well as with the U.S. Air Service and the U.S. Navy. The JN-4C was fitted with experimental wings, but only one was built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The JN-4D, the definitive design of the JN series, was introduced in June 1917, just one month after the United States entered the First World War. Principal design changes for this model included a control stick substituted for the control wheel, ailerons only on the upper wing, and curved cut-outs on the inner trailing edges of all four wing panels. This last change provided easier cockpit entry and egress."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Wartime demand for the JN-4D quickly outstripped Curtiss' production capacity and the U.S. Air Service let contracts with six other American manufacturers: Fowler Airplane Corporation, Liberty Iron Works, Springfield Aircraft Corporation, St. Louis Aircraft Corporation, U.S. Aircraft Corporation, and Howell & Lesser. Canadian Aeroplanes, Ltd., was also called upon to deliver JN-4 Canucks under an existing contract for JN-4Ds, in order to meet the dramatic increase in wartime demand."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The U.S. Air Service found more applications for the JN-4 and this resulted in another JN variant with a more powerful engine. A requirement for an advanced trainer led to the development of the JN-4H, with a 150-horsepower Wright-Martin-built, Hispano-Suiza engine in place of the 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5. The JN-4H, with a strengthened structure and increased fuel capacity, spawned a number of purpose-built variants, including the JN-4HT, a dual-control trainer, the JN-4HB, a bomber trainer fitted with bomb racks, and the JN-4HG, a single-control gunnery trainer. Further minor improvements in the JN-4H series led to the JN-6H, the principal change being a reversion to strut-connected ailerons on both wings."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The U.S. Navy procured 201 JN series aircraft during the period 1917 to 1923. Most of these aircraft were JN-4Hs received from U.S. Air Service stocks, and they were used by the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps as landplane trainers. The Navy also adopted a modified Jenny, designated the N-9, for primary seaplane training. These aircraft, fitted with a pontoon and wingtip floats, were powered by Hispano-Suiza or Curtiss OXX engines. Five hundred and ten N-9s were purchased from the Curtiss and Burgess companies, although Naval air cadets disliked the under-performing N-9."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The final iteration of the JN series was the JNS, or Standard Jenny. This designation, appearing in 1923, was used to identify obsolescent JN-4H and JN-6H models that were rebuilt and modified, with a reversion, once again, to ailerons on the top wing only.

There was a substantial demand for the surplus aircraft and the government invited bids from the manufacturers and others with overhaul and repair facilities. Curtiss bought back $20 million worth of equipment, mostly Jennys and OX-5 engines, at a cost of 13 cents on the dollar. Curtiss quickly began refurbishing and aggressively marketing these aircraft. The British, in the meantime, were moving even more quickly to dispose of their surplus inventory, and hundreds of Canadian JN-4 Canucks began to flood the American market."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In mid 1919, Curtiss began offering new Jennys to the public at a cost of $4,000, and new OX-5 engines for $1,000. At the same time, Curtiss began an extensive marketing campaign highlighting the many civilian applications of the Jenny, which included commuting, photo-mapping, policing, medical use, forest patrol, real estate work, and pleasure flying, proclaiming that \"the JN is a good machine for the sportsman. It stunts well and develops great speed as compared with land conveyances. It has been used in all the exhibitions by the U.S. Army flyers, and by most of the flyers who have exhibited since the close of the war.\" It was this last application that would make the Jenny an enduring legend. The Jenny, and to a lesser extent, the Standard J-1, would be the principal aerial mounts for those gypsy fliers called barnstormers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the 1920s, civilian pilots roamed the countryside, giving passenger rides and putting on aerial circuses that drew hundreds of people, making as much as $300 a day. The slow flying Jenny was perfect for wing-walkers who clung to the Jenny's maze of struts, the straight wheel axle, or the king posts above the wings while performing death-defying stunts for the crowds below."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Pilots found a myriad of ways to improve the performance of their Jennys, which included clipping wings or adding high-lift monoplane wings, using more efficient propellers, and replacing the 90-horsepower Curtiss OX-5 engine with a 150-horsepower Hispano-Suiza, or any one of a number of other widely available surplus engines. Pilots could also enhance the performance of their OX-5 engines by installing conversion kits that included silver-bronze bearings; three-ring, high-compression pistons; perfect circle piston rings; new magnetos; replaceable valve guides and seats; new valves and intake controls; roller rocker arms; and grease-tight and fail-proof intake rocker arms and pins. Thirty-eight hundred of these Miller conversion kits, named after their developer, were sold."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Jenny prices continued to drop as the air services began selling surplus stocks directly to the public and used Jennys would eventually change hands among private owners for as little as $50. Unused OX-5 engines sold for $250."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1925, new and more efficient designs were being offered to a more affluent and demanding public, and interest in the Jenny began to wane. Two years later, newly instituted Federal airworthiness requirements for both airplanes and pilots brought the Jenny and Barnstorming Era to a close, for the venerable Jenny could not meet the requirements. By 1930, Jenny hulks and components could be found all over the country."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On November 25, 1918, only days after the Armistice, the Smithsonian Institution acquired a JN-4D Jenny from the U.S. Air Service for the national aeronautical collection.

Beneath the clouds of the planet, the theory offered, was a warm, watery world and the possibility of aquatic and amphibious life. \"It was reasoned that if the oceans of Venus still exist, then the Venusian clouds may be composed of water droplets,\" noted a 1963 publication about the Mariner 2 mission; \"if Venus were covered by water, it was suggested that it might be inhabited by Venusian equivalents of Earth's Cambrian period of 500 million years ago, and the same steamy atmosphere could be a possibility.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Mariner 2 helped to determine that none of these speculations were true.

The record was set over a specially instrumented course near Santa Ana, California."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Since Hughes did not require a sponsor for the aircraft, the H-1 had no markings except the license number NR258Y (later NX 258Y) in chrome yellow against the dark blue background of the wings, and in black against the doped aluminum rudder. The fuselage was left in its natural polished aluminum finish. The H-1 was powered by a Pratt and Whitney Twin Wasp Junior radial piston engine, which was rated at 700 horsepower at 8,500 feet but which could deliver 1,000 horsepower for high-speed flight. A wind tunnel model of the aircraft was exhaustively tested in the 200-mph wind tunnel at the California Institute of Technology’s Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory.

Hughes departed Los Angeles before dawn and arrived at Newark Airport, outside New York City, 7 hours, 28 minutes, and 25 seconds later. His average speed over the 2,490-mile course was 332 mph, and this nonstop flight was truly an outstanding accomplishment."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Hughes H-1 was designed for record-setting purposes, but it also had an impact on the design of high-performance aircraft for years to come. Some of the outstanding design features of the H-1 were: a close fitting bell-shaped engine cowling to reduce airframe drag and improve engine cooling; gently curving wing fillets between the wing and the fuselage to help stabilize the airflow, reduce drag, and prevent potentially dangerous eddying and tail buffeting; and retractable landing gear to reduce drag and increase speed and range (typical of everything or the H-1, the landing gear was so perfectly fitted that the gear fairings and doors are difficult to see without looking closely). All rivets and joints are flush with the aircraft’s aluminum alloy skin as are the flathead and counter-sunk screws on the plywood wings. The ailerons are designed to droop 15 degrees when the flaps are fully extended to improve lift along the full length of the wing during landing and takeoff. The pilot sits in a smoothly faired and totally enclosed cockpit, which had an adjustable canopy windscreen to permit easy entry and exit from the aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Hughes H-1 racer was a major milestone aircraft on the road to such radial engine-powered World War II fighters as the American Grumman F6F Hellcat and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, the Japanese Mitsubishi Type 0 (Zero), and the German Focke-WuIf FW 190.

Moreover, some accidents occurred on the ground when passengers in the rear cockpit walked into the propeller after deplaning. The Junior was modified as an amphibian and called the Duck, but an accident in which a pilot was killed after he put the aircraft into a shallow, inverted dive seriously damaged the aircraft's reputation."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"That accident and decreasing sales put an end to the production of the Junior.

The total aircraft flight time was listed as 636 hours. G.C. Acord of Dallas, Texas, who owned the aircraft in 1945 and 1946, had the airframe nearly rebuilt and recovered. L.M. Angevine and R.C. Christopher of Bainbridge, Georgia, bought the aircraft in 1950 and noted in 1954 that it had 127 flight hours \"since new\" and that the original log book was lost.

Early in 1963, the Grafton Water Ski Club in New South Wales, Australia, asked Dickenson to build a kite for an upcoming water ski festival. Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite.

He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and just behind the control bar, and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips. From the hanging strap, he suspended the pilot’s seat. The strap supported the pilot like a pendulum and allowed him or her to shift their weight with ease, pushing and pulling the control bar to make the glider climb, dive, or turn."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Dickenson tested the controls on a half-size flexible Rogallo-type wing too small to fly. The tests were promising so Dickenson built a kite large enough to lift a person.

By 1966, Dickenson was selling his adaptation of the Rogallo-type wing ski kite fitted with his new control system, and in 1967, he introduced fellow Australian Bill Bennett to the booming sport of flying ski-kites. Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name.

The main material is a .635-centimeter (1/4-inch) sandwich of paper honeycomb and graphite fiber, carefully molded and cured in an oven. The entire airframe was constructed without using metal, and weighs only 425 kilograms (939 pounds). Voyager took more than 22,000 work hours and more than 18 months to construct. The long, thin main wing was so flexible that the wing tip deflected upward 0.9 to 1 .5 meters (3 to 5 feet) while the aircraft was in flight. The purpose of the winglets was to raise the fuel vent from the three outboard wing tanks high enough to keep fuel from draining out onto the ground. The cabin area and cockpit were side by side within the fuselage."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Voyager was virtually a flying fuel tank. It had eight storage tanks on each side of the airplane and a fuel tank in the center, for a total of 17 tanks. The pilot shifted fuel from tank to tank during the flight to keep the airplane in balance. The 3,181 kilograms (7,011 pounds) of fuel aboard at takeoff amounted to 72.3 percent of its gross takeoff weight. At the end of the flight only 48 kilograms (106 pounds) of fuel remained. Two engines, one at each end of the fuselage, powered the aircraft. The highly efficient 110-hp, liquid-cooled rear engine, a Teledyne Continental IOL-200, ran during the entire flight except for four minutes when a fuel problem caused a temporary shutdown. The 130-hp, air-cooled front engine, a Teledyne Continental 0-240, was used for a total of 70 hours and 8 minutes during the initial, heavyweight stage of the flight, and also while climbing over weather and at other critical times. Voyager was equipped with Hartzell constant-speed, variable-pitch aluminum propellers that proved to be a critical factor in stretching the aircraft's range enough to bring it home. These propellers were designed, built, and delivered in only 17 days after one of the original propellers failed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Voyager's takeoff roll at Edwards AFB lasted two minutes and six seconds with less than 244 meters (800 feet) of the 4,572-meter (15,000-foot) runway left at liftoff. Both winglets were damaged during takeoff when the wing tips dragged along the runway. Soon after takeoff, an attempt was made to deliberately dislodge the damaged winglets over Edwards Air Force Base so that if structural damage occurred to the aircraft's fuel tanks, it could land as soon as possible. To dislodge the winglets, the crew increased flight speed and maneuvered the airplane to build up side forces sufficiently high to break them free. About eight kilometers (five miles) from the base the right winglet was dislodged and fell into someone's yard. It is now in storage at the Museum's Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland. The other winglet was also successfully dislodged, but was never found."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following a route determined by weather, wind, and geography, Voyager flew an official distance of 42,212 kilometers (24,986 miles) at an official speed of 186 kilometers per hour (116 miles per hour), in an elapsed time of 216 hours, 3 minutes, and 44 seconds. Flying Voyager, Rutan and Yeager established eight absolute and world class records. On the second day of the flight over the Pacific Ocean, they were guided by meteorologists through the edges of Typhoon Marge to obtain a \"slingshot effect\" from tailwinds. These winds increased Voyager's ground speed to 130 knots (150 mph)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Voyager's optimum altitude for fuel economy was 2,438 meters (8,000 feet), but the crew flew as high as 6,248 meters (20,500 feet) over Africa to avoid thunderstorms. Over the Atlantic Ocean near Brazil, a violent storm at night turned Voyager on a 90-degree bank, but the flight through the Caribbean was pleasingly uneventful. A final scare occurred on the last morning when the strainer on a small fuel pump and an air pocket in the line starved the rear engine of fuel and it stopped. The aircraft lost 1,524 meters (5,000 feet) of altitude while Rutan and Yeager made an emergency restart of the front engine. While the aircraft struggled to climb, the air block was overcome and the rear engine was restarted. The aircraft leveled off at 1,067 meters (3,500 feet) and they landed a few hours later at Edwards Air Force Base."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Throughout the flight, the physical and mental capabilities of the pilots were continually tested by mechanical and severe weather problems, as well as by the cramped quarters. The pilot in the cockpit flew the airplane, navigated, maintained ground communication, and transferred fuel to balance the airplane. The other pilot in the cabin area rested, managed the logistics support tasks of the flight, or provided navigation and flight-monitoring assistance. In reality, neither pilot found the time or comfort for much rest, yet both were in remarkably good condition at the end of the flight.

At the flight's conclusion, they landed at Washington-Dulles International Airport and turned the airplane over to the Smithsonian."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"No reconnaissance aircraft in history has operated in more hostile airspace or with such complete impunity than the SR-71 Blackbird. It is the fastest aircraft propelled by air-breathing engines. The Blackbird's performance and operational achievements placed it at the pinnacle of aviation technology developments during the Cold War. The airplane was conceived when tensions with communist Eastern Europe reached levels approaching a full-blown crisis in the mid-1950s. U.S. military commanders desperately needed accurate assessments of Soviet worldwide military deployments, particularly near the Iron Curtain. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's subsonic U-2 (see NASM collection) reconnaissance aircraft was an able platform but the U. S. Air Force recognized that this relatively slow aircraft was already vulnerable to Soviet interceptors. They also understood that the rapid development of surface-to-air missile systems could put U-2 pilots at grave risk. The danger proved reality when a U-2 was shot down by a surface to air missile over the Soviet Union in 1960."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Lockheed's first proposal for a new high speed, high altitude, reconnaissance aircraft, to be capable of avoiding interceptors and missiles, centered on a design propelled by liquid hydrogen. This proved to be impracticable because of considerable fuel consumption. Lockheed then reconfigured the design for conventional fuels. This was feasible and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), already flying the Lockheed U-2, issued a production contract for an aircraft designated the A-12. Lockheed's clandestine 'Skunk Works' division (headed by the gifted design engineer Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson) designed the A-12 to cruise at Mach 3.2 and fly well above 18,288 m (60,000 feet). To meet these challenging requirements, Lockheed engineers overcame many daunting technical challenges. Flying more than three times the speed of sound generates 316° C (600° F) temperatures on external aircraft surfaces, which are enough to severely weaken the structure of conventional aluminum airframes. The design team chose to make the jet's external skin of titanium alloy to which shielded the internal aluminum airframe. Two conventional, but very powerful, afterburning turbine engines propelled this remarkable aircraft. These power plants had to operate across a huge speed envelope in flight, from a takeoff speed of 334 kph (207 mph) to more than 3,540 kph (2,200 mph). To prevent supersonic shock waves from moving inside the engine intake causing flameouts, Johnson's team had to design a complex air intake and bypass system for the engines."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Skunk Works engineers also optimized the A-12 cross-section design to exhibit a low radar profile. Lockheed hoped to achieve this by carefully shaping the airframe to reflect as little transmitted radar energy (radio waves) as possible, and by application of special paint designed to absorb, rather than reflect, those waves. This treatment became one of the first applications of stealth technology, but it never completely met the design goals."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Test pilot Lou Schalk flew the single-seat A-12 on April 24, 1962, after he became airborne accidentally during high-speed taxi trials. The airplane showed great promise but it needed considerable technical refinement before the CIA could fly the first operational sortie on May 31, 1967 - a surveillance flight over North Vietnam. A-12s, flown by CIA pilots, operated as part of the Air Force's 1129th Special Activities Squadron under the \"Oxcart\" program. While Lockheed continued to refine the A-12, the U. S. Air Force ordered an interceptor version of the aircraft designated the YF-12A. The Skunk Works, however, proposed a \"specific mission\" version configured to conduct post-nuclear strike reconnaissance. This system evolved into the USAF's familiar SR-71."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Lockheed built fifteen A-12s, including a special two-seat trainer version. Two A-12s were modified to carry a special reconnaissance drone, designated D-21. The modified A-12s were redesignated M-21s. These were designed to take off with the D-21 drone, powered by a Marquart ramjet engine mounted on a pylon between the rudders. The M-21 then hauled the drone aloft and launched it at speeds high enough to ignite the drone's ramjet motor. Lockheed also built three YF-12As but this type never went into production. Two of the YF-12As crashed during testing. Only one survives and is on display at the USAF Museum in Dayton, Ohio. The aft section of one of the \"written off\" YF-12As which was later used along with an SR-71A static test airframe to manufacture the sole SR-71C trainer. One SR-71 was lent to NASA and designated YF-12C. Including the SR-71C and two SR-71B pilot trainers, Lockheed constructed thirty-two Blackbirds. The first SR-71 flew on December 22, 1964. Because of extreme operational costs, military strategists decided that the more capable USAF SR-71s should replace the CIA's A-12s. These were retired in 1968 after only one year of operational missions, mostly over southeast Asia. The Air Force's 1st Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron (part of the 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing) took over the missions, flying the SR-71 beginning in the spring of 1968."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After the Air Force began to operate the SR-71, it acquired the official name Blackbird-- for the special black paint that covered the airplane. This paint was formulated to absorb radar signals, to radiate some of the tremendous airframe heat generated by air friction, and to camouflage the aircraft against the dark sky at high altitudes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Experience gained from the A-12 program convinced the Air Force that flying the SR-71 safely required two crew members, a pilot and a Reconnaissance Systems Officer (RSO). The RSO operated with the wide array of monitoring and defensive systems installed on the airplane. This equipment included a sophisticated Electronic Counter Measures (ECM) system that could jam most acquisition and targeting radar. In addition to an array of advanced, high-resolution cameras, the aircraft could also carry equipment designed to record the strength, frequency, and wavelength of signals emitted by communications and sensor devices such as radar. The SR-71 was designed to fly deep into hostile territory, avoiding interception with its tremendous speed and high altitude. It could operate safely at a maximum speed of Mach 3.3 at an altitude more than sixteen miles, or 25,908 m (85,000 ft), above the earth. The crew had to wear pressure suits similar to those worn by astronauts. These suits were required to protect the crew in the event of sudden cabin pressure loss while at operating altitudes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To climb and cruise at supersonic speeds, the Blackbird's Pratt & Whitney J-58 engines were designed to operate continuously in afterburner. While this would appear to dictate high fuel flows, the Blackbird actually achieved its best \"gas mileage,\" in terms of air nautical miles per pound of fuel burned, during the Mach 3+ cruise. A typical Blackbird reconnaissance flight might require several aerial refueling operations from an airborne tanker. Each time the SR-71 refueled, the crew had to descend to the tanker's altitude, usually about 6,000 m to 9,000 m (20,000 to 30,000 ft), and slow the airplane to subsonic speeds. As velocity decreased, so did frictional heat. This cooling effect caused the aircraft's skin panels to shrink considerably, and those covering the fuel tanks contracted so much that fuel leaked, forming a distinctive vapor trail as the tanker topped off the Blackbird. As soon as the tanks were filled, the jet's crew disconnected from the tanker, relit the afterburners, and again climbed to high altitude."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Air Force pilots flew the SR-71 from Kadena AB, Japan, throughout its operational career but other bases hosted Blackbird operations, too. The 9th SRW occasionally deployed from Beale AFB, California, to other locations to carryout operational missions. Cuban missions were flown directly from Beale. The SR-71 did not begin to operate in Europe until 1974, and then only temporarily. In 1982, when the U.S. Air Force based two aircraft at Royal Air Force Base Mildenhall to fly monitoring mission in Eastern Europe."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When the SR-71 became operational, orbiting reconnaissance satellites had already replaced manned aircraft to gather intelligence from sites deep within Soviet territory. Satellites could not cover every geopolitical hotspot so the Blackbird remained a vital tool for global intelligence gathering. On many occasions, pilots and RSOs flying the SR-71 provided information that proved vital in formulating successful U. S. foreign policy. Blackbird crews provided important intelligence about the 1973 Yom Kippur War, the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and its aftermath, and pre- and post-strike imagery of the 1986 raid conducted by American air forces on Libya. In 1987, Kadena-based SR-71 crews flew a number of missions over the Persian Gulf, revealing Iranian Silkworm missile batteries that threatened commercial shipping and American escort vessels."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As the performance of space-based surveillance systems grew, along with the effectiveness of ground-based air defense networks, the Air Force started to lose enthusiasm for the expensive program and the 9th SRW ceased SR-71 operations in January 1990. Despite protests by military leaders, Congress revived the program in 1995. Continued wrangling over operating budgets, however, soon led to final termination. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration retained two SR-71As and the one SR-71B for high-speed research projects and flew these airplanes until 1999."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On March 6, 1990, the service career of one Lockheed SR-71A Blackbird ended with a record-setting flight. This special airplane bore Air Force serial number 61-7972. Lt. Col. Ed Yeilding and his RSO, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Vida, flew this aircraft from Los Angeles to Washington D.C. in 1 hour, 4 minutes, and 20 seconds, averaging a speed of 3,418 kph (2,124 mph). At the conclusion of the flight, '972 landed at Dulles International Airport and taxied into the custody of the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. At that time, Lt. Col.

The Reisen outclassed all Allied fighter aircraft for the first six months of the war until American carrier forces stopped the Japanese in the Coral Sea and at Midway in May and June 1942, respectively. The loss of four Japanese aircraft carriers at Midway underscored a deadly trend. The Japanese were losing experienced pilots and aircraft faster than they could replace them. Yet for almost two more years the ZEKE, as the Allies code-named it, remained an ominous threat."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Key to the Zero's potent performance was weight. In May 1937, the Japanese naval staff issued preliminary specifications for a fighter to fly from aircraft carriers. To satisfy these demanding requirements, Mitsubishi designer Jiro Horikoshi and his team focused specifically on reducing airframe weight as much as possible. Horikoshi used a new lightweight aluminum alloy developed in Japan and he chose to omit armor plate and self-sealing fuel tanks from the design. These protective devices weighed hundred of kilograms and could not be incorporated if Mitsubishi hoped to meet the performance requirements specified by the navy. Yet the lack of these components eventually became the Zero's undoing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Reisen was considerably lighter than American fighters. It could climb faster and out-maneuver them in close combat or 'dog fighting.' But as combat experience mounted and training improved, the American tactics began to change. U. S. Navy and Army pilots avoided the turning and looping dogfight and began to engage the Zeros only when they could surprise the Japanese pilots by attacking with a height or speed advantage. This type of attack consisted of a single, straight pass with guns blazing. The American pilot then continued away from the Zero using his superior speed to zoom to safety or circle around at a distance and attack again. This idea and other tactics transformed pilots flying the Grumman F4F Wildcat (once considered totally obsolete against the Zero) into formidable opponents more than capable of destroying the Japanese fighter."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Allies began fielding aircraft superior to the Zero in 1942.

To establish the speed of the airplane, a course was set up from Fort Myer to Shooter's Hill in Alexandria, Virginia, a distance of 8 km (5 mi). After waiting several days for optimum wind conditions, Orville and Foulois made the ten-mile round trip on July 30. The out lap speed was 37.7 mph and the return lap was 47.4 mph, giving an average speed of 42.5 mph.

The manager of the Wright Company, Frank Russell, learned that the Smithsonian Institution was interested in the first Army airplane and would welcome its donation to the national museum. The War Department agreed and approved the transfer on May 4, 1911. The aircraft was restored close to its original 1909 configuration, but a few non-original braces added for the wheeled landing gear in 1910 remained on the airplane when it was turned over to the Smithsonian.

The Viking mission used two identical spacecraft, each consisting of a lander and an orbiter.

Astronomer Percival Lowell became interested in Mars during the latter part of the nineteenth century, and he built what became the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona, to study the planet. He argued that Mars had once been a watery planet and that the topographical features known as canals had been built by intelligent beings. The idea of intelligent life on Mars remained in the popular imagination for a long time, and only with the first photographs from Mars by Mariner 4 in 1965 were the hopes of many dashed that life might be present on Mars. This images showed a cratered, ­lunar-­like surface without structures and canals, nothing that even remotely resembled a pattern that intelligent life might produce. U.S. News and World Report announced at the time that “Mars is dead.”"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Later spacecraft, especially Mariners 6 and 7, in 1969, reexcited curiosity and laid the groundwork for an eventual landing on the planet. Their pictures verified the Moon‑like appearance of Mars, but they also found that volcanoes had once been active on the planet, that the frost observed seasonally on the poles was made of carbon dioxide, and that huge plates indicated considerable tectonic activity in the planet’s past. Suddenly, Mars fascinated scientists, reporters, and the public once again, largely because of the possibility of past life that might have existed there."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Viking mission that emerged from this excitement consisted of two identical spacecraft, each with a lander and an orbiter. Launched in 1975 from the Kennedy Space Center, Florida, Viking 1 spent nearly a year cruising to Mars, placed an orbiter in operation around the planet, and landed on July 20, 1976, on the Chryse Planitia (Golden Plains), with Viking 2 following in September 1976. These were the first sustained landings on another planet in the solar system. While one of the most important scientific activities of this project involved an attempt to determine whether there was life on Mars, the scientific data returned mitigated against the possibility. The two landers continuously monitored weather at the landing sites and found both exciting cyclical variations and an exceptionally harsh climate that prohibited the possibility of life. Atmospheric temperatures at the more southern Viking 1 landing site, for instance, was only as high as +7 degrees Fahrenheit at midday, but the predawn summer temperature was ‑107 degrees Fahrenheit. And the lowest predawn temperature was ‑184 degrees Fahrenheit, about the frost point of carbon dioxide."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although the three biology experiments contained on the landers discovered unexpected and enigmatic chemical activity in the Martian soil, they provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms in soil near the landing sites. According to scientists, Mars was self‑sterilizing. They concluded that the combination of solar ultraviolet radiation that saturates the surface, the extreme dryness of the soil, and the oxidizing nature of the soil chemistry had prevented the formation of living organisms in the Martian soil."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The failure to find any evidence of life on Mars, past or present, devastated the optimism of scientists involved in the search for extraterrestrial life. Collectively, these missions led to the development of two essential reactions. The first was an abandonment by most scientists that life might exist elsewhere in the Solar System. Planetary scientist and JPL director Bruce Murray complained at the time of Viking about the lander being ballyhooed as a definite means of ascertaining whether or not life existed on Mars. The public expected to find it, and so did many of the other scientists involved in the project. Murray argued that “the extraordinarily hostile environment revealed by the Mariner flybys made life there so unlikely that public expectations should not be raised.” Murray believed that the legacy of failure to detect life, despite the billions spent and a succession of overoptimistic statements, would spark public disappointment and perhaps a public outrage. Murray was right. The immediate result was that NASA did not return to Mars for two decades. The Viking Program’s chief scientist, Gerald A Soffen, commented in 1992: “If somebody back then had given me 100 to 1 odds that we wouldn’t go back to Mars for 17 years, I would’ve said, ‘You’re crazy’.”"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The second reaction, never accepted by scientists, found a powerful public life. Some asserted that a corrupt Federal government, and its mandarins of science, had found evidence of life beyond Earth but was keeping it from the public for reasons ranging from stupidity to diabolical plots. NASA has had to respond to these charges repeatedly thereafter. This issue first arose on 25 July 1976 when the Viking 1 orbiter took an image of the Cydonia region of Mars that looked like a human face. All evidence suggests that this was the result of shadows on the hills, and Gerry Soffen said so at a press conference, but some refused to accept this position. The “face” remains a sore point to the present, with Soffen being asked about it many times over the years. Always, he stated it was not the remnant of some ancient civilization but was a natural feature lit oddly in this one image but not in any others. As NASA stated officially in 2001, “The ‘Face on Mars’ has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars—evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists.

The Cessna 120 was an austere version of the 140 two-place, metal, tail wheel aircraft and both were intended for pilot training and inexpensive flying. Nearly 5,000 of the 120/140 series were built from 1945 until 1951 when the market for this class of airplane became so thoroughly saturated that Cessna stopped building two-place airplanes for seven years."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To signal its re-entry into the two-place market in 1957, Cessna redesigned the 120/140 series with tricycle gear and a Continental O-200 hp engine and designated it the 150 series. The prototype all-metal, high-wing, side-by-side 150 first flew in September 1957 and received its FAA Type Certificate in July 1958. For the student pilot, tricycle gears moved the center of gravity and lowered the nose of the aircraft, thus improving forward visibility, and featured a steerable nose wheel, all of which made the aircraft easier to take off, land and taxi. It was fast becoming the standard for general aviation aircraft, and was already available in the larger 172 and 182 four-place models. The 150 was offered in three basic models: the Standard/Trainer, the Commuter, and the A150 Aerobat. The Commuter \"deluxe\" version had a slight increase in wingspan and was more suitable to cross country flight than the more austere Standard due to its additional equipment: a vacuum system for the added directional and horizon gyros, wheel fairings, individually adjustable bucket seats, interior carpet, conical camber wing tips, heated pitot tube, and an \"Omni Flash\" beacon. The A150K through M Aerobat offered a strengthened fuselage, full harness, quick release doors, and cabin skylight windows for safe aerobatic flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The C150's fuselage is a semi-monocoque structure with a control wheel in lieu of the conventional stick type control, but the wheel made for a narrow cabin as any 150 student pilot and instructor will attest. Later designs marginally improved this problem. The \"Land-O-Matic\" tricycle landing gear is configured with the Cessna cantilevered tapered spring steel tube main gear, with hydraulically operated brakes; and the steerable nose wheel on an oleo-pneumatic shock strut. The wing is a single strut-braced all-metal structure that has modified Frieze metal ailerons and electrically operated NACA single-slotted metal flaps. The tail assembly is a cantilevered all metal-assembly with swept-back vertical surfaces.

Only 1,483 of these were Aerobats. Cessna built the vast majority of the series in Wichita, but Reims Aviation in France built nearly 2,500 under Cessna license. Cessna halted production of single-engine piston aircraft in the 1986 when a product liability crisis and other economic woes threatened the future of small light planes. However with the passage of the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act, which limited manufacturer's liability, and with other new entry level single engine aircraft on the horizon, Cessna resumed building models172 and 182 in 1997. Cessna has produced more entry level private aircraft than any other aircraft manufacturer and this rugged little trainer is still found at most general aviation airports.

A pilot for 61 years, Kershner flew over 11,000 hours total military and civilian time in aircraft with 4,300 hours as an instructor. He performed over 7,000 spins, of up to 21 turns, sometimes filming his aircraft adorned with ribbons or cones for analysis and instruction. He authored, and regularly updated, five comprehensive manuals on primary, advanced, aerobatic, instructor, and instrument flying, all of which have been used by thousands of pilots, and his own personal memoir Logging Flight Time. Kershner contributed numerous training and safety articles to aviation magazines and was a frequent lecturer, always illustrating his technical lessons with a mix of dry humor, aviation banter, and common sense.

The standard 492-liter (130-gallon) fuel tank, located in the leading edge of the wing, was supplemented by a 1,552-liter (410-gallon) tank in the wing center section and a 700-liter (185-gallon) tank mounted in the fuselage cabin area.

They remained aloft long enough, however, to test the performance of the airplane under extended flight conditions. The second attempt ended at Fort Benjamin Harrison, near Indianapolis, when a cracked water jacket caused the engine to seize.

During flight tests, the airplane exhibited outstanding performance, particularly in level-flight speed. The British enthusiastically ordered 150 examples of the airplane and the Royal Air Force (RAF) named it the Mustang. The U. S. Army Air Corps also showed interest and in 1941 they ordered 500 ground-attack variants designated the A-36."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Early in 1942, the British tested four RAF Mustangs fitted with the two-stage, two-speed Merlin 65 engine. The supercharger in the Merlin 65 was optimized to produce sea-level horsepower up to approximately 9,150 m (30,000 ft). Urged on by Rolls Royce and British and American fighter pilots who sampled the new Mustang, North American obtained two Merlin 61 engines similar to the 65 and installed them in airframes designated XP-51Bs. The new variant had good range and outstanding speed, about 80 kph (50 mph) faster than previous models. Thus was born the world's best long-range, propeller-driven escort fighter. With improved range and speed, P-51 squadrons could now accompany 8th Air Force bombers on long-range raids over Europe. Bomber losses dropped sharply when fighters could protect them during their entire mission. The Mustang also proved itself in the Pacific theater. Again, the P-51 had the range, speed, and endurance to escort Boeing B-29 Superfortresses conducting long-range bombing attacks. The newly independent U. S. Air Force used the airplane during the Korean War for close-support, ground attack missions but it was not suited for this dangerous mission. One of the Mustang's few vulnerable spots was the cooling system. A single bullet through a radiator or pipe was usually enough to down a P-51."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"North American built more than 14,000 Mustangs and more D-models (8,302) than all other variants combined. The most significant D-model features were a rear fuselage reduced in height to accommodate a new bubble canopy and an increase in armament from 4 to 6 fifty-caliber machine guns. The Air Force did not withdraw P-51s from service until 1957."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"North American built the NASM P-51D-30-NA, Air Force serial number 44-74939, late in 1945. It was not delivered until July 1945 and never saw combat. The Army Air Forces first assigned the fighter to Andrews Field, outside Washington, D.C., and later to Freeman Field, Indiana. After eleven months and 211 flying hours of operational service, this Mustang was set aside as a museum specimen and later transferred to the National Air Museum. When NASM acquired this Mustang, it bore a proud admonition on both sides of the fuselage in large black letters: \"Guard The Victory, Join the AAF.\" The airplane was probably used for recruiting drives toward the end of its military career. For exhibit purposes, this Mustang is painted in the colors and markings of the 351st Fighter Squadron, 353rd Fighter Group, 8th Air Force. This unit converted from North American P-47 Thunderbolts to Mustangs on September 30, 1944, while stationed at Raydon, Suffolk, England. The 353rd is typical of the many units assigned to escort bombers on missions deep into Germany. After air engagements to protect the bombers, the P-51s of the 353rd would attack enemy aircraft and ground installations on strafing missions on their way home. This fighter group claimed 330 1/2 aircraft shot down and 414 destroyed on the ground. It was awarded the Distinguished Unit Citation for the support of airborne landings in Holland."},{"label":"Alternate Name","content":"North American P-51D Mustang"},{"label":"Key Accomplishment(s)","content":"One of the Best Fighters of World War II"},{"label":"Brief Description","content":"The P-51 Mustang's combination of speed, range, maneuverability, and firepower gave it great versatility.

This sufficed on clear days, but when it rained the water-soluble glue dissolved. Ecker dealt with this problem by applying a coat of varnish over the glue. The spruce wing structure was simple, with little internal bracing, even by 1912 standards. Basic aircraft hardware was largely improvised. Strut fittings were hand-made from sheet steel, and the turnbuckles used to put tension in the bracing and control wires were refashioned motorcycle spokes."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As with the rest of the airplane, the engine was somewhat makeshift. Ecker converted a Roberts six-cylinder marine engine for aeronautical use. He removed several unnecessary components to save weight and added an automobile radiator for cooling. Later a second radiator was fitted to cure continual overheating problems. Two carburetors fed fuel into a unique rotary-valve intake that in turn redistributed the fuel to the individual cylinders. It generated between 50 and 65 horsepower. The six-gallon fuel capacity provided for twenty to thirty minutes of flying time. The engine had no exhaust pipe. Hot exhaust simply spewed out of each cylinder under the wing, requiring a protective aluminum sheath on the upper center-section fabric. There were no engine instruments; all adjustments were made by judgement according to the sound of the engine."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Like many of the one-off aircraft built and flown by lesser-known pioneers, the configuration of the Ecker Flying Boat changed several times during its operational life. Initially it was fitted with a wheeled landing gear. Later, pontoons replaced the wheels to allow flying off water. In its final and present form, the Ecker features an actual boat hull made of spruce, oak, and ash, sealed internally with oil and externally with a hand-rubbed gray enamel finish. The hull reportedly had wheeled beaching gear to move the aircraft from water to land and vice versa, but no information on the size and style of the wheels exists."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The flying record of the Ecker is as hazy as the history of its construction. By the time the aircraft in the NASM collection took to the air, Ecker had built a modest local reputation as a pilot and an exhibition flyer in his home territory of western New York State. In a pontoon-fitted hydro-aeroplane (possibly an earlier configuration of the NASM aircraft), Ecker was the first to fly in his home town of Syracuse, New York, making a successful takeoff from nearby Onondaga Lake in 1911. By 1912, he was taking passengers aloft and doing exhibitions at fairs and other public gatherings. Some of this exhibition flying was certainly done with the aircraft in the NASM collection, but exactly when and where or in which of its many configurations the airplane appeared is unknown. The only direct reference to the flight history of this airplane is a vague statement made by Ecker in a 1930s newspaper interview in which he said he flew it extensively for a period of three years and then placed it in storage. The Ecker Flying Boat emerged one more time before it came to NASM when it was displayed at the 1930 New York State Fair."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The story becomes murky again until the somewhat tattered airframe of the Ecker was discovered in the upper loft of a downtown Syracuse TV sales and repair shop in 1958. The components of the now ancient flying boat were gingerly hoisted out of a fourth floor window and transported to the home of the proud new owner, Owen Billman, to await restoration. Before long, news of the find reached the airplane's original builder and pilot, Herman Ecker, who was by then living out a happy retirement in Florida. Ecker prevailed upon the discoverer of his long-lost flying boat to donate the airplane to the Smithsonian Institution. In 1961 the Ecker arrived at NASM and was stored until its restoration in 1981-1982."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023562-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Pressure, Japanese Army","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv92477439a-5a28-48f3-be4a-88479ff231bc","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"55mm diameter; black face; 0 to 1.0; World War II; 2-fittings on rear."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023567-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Japanese Army, Type-98, Ki-45","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv95f177b73-adda-4d6b-9e5f-c2ad5decb14a","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"83mm diameter; black face; 0 to 10; red warning light; for nick; World War II"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023304-0","title":"Indicator, Turn and Bank, A-11, from B-29","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv97803d4d0-e761-49c2-96f1-12e0d5acb5d1","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"3-1/8in.dia.; WW2; type a-11; from b-29; ball in liquid indicator"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022796-1","title":"Indicator, Coolant Temperature","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9faacc64a-5329-4961-9faa-1132c8863189","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"55mm diameter, 45mm long; complete with tube and bulb; range 40 to 100c"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023384-1","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, E-1","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9cfe3ffeb-828b-4439-8c52-330776053b2c","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"3-1/4in.dia.; range 0-300amps; WW2; type e-1;pos.& neg.poles"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400025497-0","title":"BMW Model IIIA In-line 6 Engine","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9a2e7e096-f0e8-41f3-83a2-74bd800424b4","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Type: Reciprocating, In-line, 6 cylinders, liquid-cooled,"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Power Rating: 134 kW (180 hp) at 1410 rpm"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Displacement: 19.058 L (1,163 cu in.)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Bore and Stroke: 150 mm (5.9 in) x 180 mm (7.1 in)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Weight: 293 kg (644 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"The Daimler-Benz company's virtual monopoly on the production of aircraft engines in Germany stifled research and development of other engines.

Shortly after deliveries to front-line squadrons of the Camel began, Sopwith designed a new single-seat fighter called the Snipe. The new airplane was simply intended to be a derivation of the Camel, with improved visibility for the pilot, and gentler handling qualities, more reminiscent of the earlier Sopwith Pup. It was not a radically different aircraft. Also in the spring of 1917, Britain's Air Board issued general specifications for future military aircraft designs. During the testing of six Snipe prototypes in the summer of 1917, modifications were made to bring the new Sopwith design in line with the Air Board's specifications. The most notable change was the expansion of the biplane wing cell to two bays instead of the typical single-bay configuration. By early 1918, the Air Board issued yet another set of aircraft specifications, referred to as Type I-Single-seat fighter (high altitude). The Snipe and three other new designs, the Austin Triplane, the Boulton & Paul Bobolink, and the Nieuport B.N.1, all intended to be powered by the new Bentley B.R.2 rotary engine, competed in Type I acceptance trials in February 1918. The four aircraft were judged to be generally similar in performance, and none was considered especially impressive. The Snipe was ultimately selected because it was thought the least undesirable overall, and because it incorporated many standard Sopwith components and its structural design was the least radical-features that increased its potential for rapid production and deployment.

It was more powerful and it had better all-round performance, but it had none of the qualities of lightning maneuver of the Camel.

But it arrived too late to have any significant operational impact. After the war, the Snipe became the standard R.A.F. night fighter.

He refurbished the Snipe with new fabric covering, refinishing of the wood, and the mounting of a 130-horsepower Clerget engine. Langevin sold the airplane to Myron A. \"Jimmy\" Romberger of Endicott, N.Y., in September 1930. Romberger converted the Snipe into a two-place airplane and in August 1932 sold it to Roosevelt Field, Inc., Mineola, N.Y., which placed it in the aviation museum at Roosevelt Field.

Palen flew the Snipe in his air shows until August 1966, when the airplane was severely damaged in a forced landing after engine trouble while piloted by Paul Richards. It was restored by Gordon Bainbridge and retired to Palen's non-flying collection. During this period, the Clerget engine was replaced with the Bentley B.R.2 that is now mounted on the airplane.

On canard airplanes, horizontal surfaces used for trim and control are mounted forward of the main lifting surface. According to Burt Rutan, the canard configuration had advantages over more conventional aircraft. It allowed him to design airplanes that a pilot could not stall so aggressively as to lose control of the aircraft. A canard configuration in the VariEze also allowed Rutan to use very short control linkages and made the airplane safer to fly."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Neither the two prototypes, nor the first VariEzes built from plans, used conventional ailerons mounted on the aft wing. Rutan opted to use only elevons attached to the canard. Elevons are both elevators that control pitch and ailerons that control roll, combined into one control surface. By using only elevons, the VariEze was simplified and easier to build."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rutan had begun to study and experiment with canard aircraft designs in 1963. He built and flew a radio-controlled flying model canard a year later while finishing his junior year at California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo. He later earned his Masters degree in Aeronautical Engineering. Rutan's line of man-carrying canard aircraft began with the VariViggen. In 1968 he started to build this all-wood airplane and he first flew it during April 1972. Rutan's VariViggen bears more than an accidental resemblance to a Swedish military jet fighter, the SAAB J-37 Viggen, which first appeared during a press preview in 1965 and helped to inspire Rutan to create a canard airplane of his own design. \"I wanted an aircraft for myself,\" Rutan recalled later, \"as close to a modern fighter as possible - something like the F-104 or the F-4 [both in NASM's collection]. I wanted a big [control] stick, an array of buttons, high rate of roll-a real 'macho machine'-where I'd really feel like I was flying a century-series fighter.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Late in 1974, Rutan began to work on the VariEze. He had already aborted another offshoot of the VariViggen called the MiniViggen that was to have been an all-aluminum canard aircraft with a high wing and a horizontal stabilizer and elevator mounted low at the nose. Testing with models in a wind tunnel and atop an automobile fitted with instrumentation forced Rutan to scrap the MiniViggen as unstable and too costly, expensive, heavy, and difficult to rebuild into various experimental configurations. Rutan now focused on building a canard aircraft out of foam and fiberglass."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Before he began building the prototype VariEze (identified as N7EZ), he spent many hours studying the surface finish and construction details on high-performance European sailplanes. Technicians built these aircraft using foam cut to shape and then covered with fiberglass and glue. Ironically, Rutan selected a less complex and less expensive variation of this 'composite' construction method to build the first VariEze because it allowed him to change the airframe quickly. He could move a wing or control surface to different positions on the fuselage, testing various configurations more quickly. Radically altering a metal airframe for testing would have slowed the work tremendously. Rutan did not decide to market the VariEze as a composite airplane made of foam and fiberglass until some time after the prototype had flown."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"To the canard configuration, Rutan added winglets to both wingtips. Richard Whitcomb, an aerodynamics specialist at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), had developed this technology during the 1950s. Winglets decreased drag to boost climb rate and cruise speed. On the VariEze, Rutan made the winglets perform double duty as vertical stabilizers and rudders to control yaw. Rutan was eager to use N7EZ to explore further the performance of the canard layout. He reasoned that by breaking the world speed records for airplanes of the VariEze weight class (less than 500 kg/1,102 lb), he could fine-tune his canard design, and prove that a properly designed canard aircraft could outperform a conventional aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first VariEze was ready after Rutan, his wife, Carolyn, and several friends worked for nearly four months. The aircraft flew in May 1975 and was powered by a Volkswagen engine modified for use in aircraft. Three months later, the VariEze appeared at the annual Experimental Aircraft Association Convention and Fly-In held at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in August 1975. Don and Julia Downey call what followed the \"Rutan Revolution.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The VariEze was so popular at Oshkosh that Burt immediately began to work on designing a VariEze specifically for homebuilders. He and his team built the second VariEze (N4EZ) during winter 1975. At a glance, N4EZ is a duplicate of N7EZ but Rutan actually redesigned the second airplane to accept a heavier, more reliable Continental A-75 engine. Every dimension changed. For example, wing area increased from 5.3 sq m (59 sq ft) to 6 sq m (67 sq ft). Rutan redesigned the canard, as well, and employed a new airfoil for this wing that aerodynamics specialists had developed at the University of Glasgow."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"He and his team began working on this airplane in December 1974 and first flew it in March 1976. During the construction, Rutan could not locate a suitable A-75 power plant, so he chose to use a Continental 0-200. This motor weighed about 13.5 kg (30 lb) more than the A-75, so Rutan added 4.5 kg (10 lb) of ballast to the nose."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rutan began publishing plans in July 1976 and the first homebuilt VariEzes began to fly less than a year later in March. At that time, it was rare indeed for builders to go from a set of plans to a flying, high-performance airplane so quickly. The key to such rapid construction lay in Rutan's choice of composite construction. To build the composite, fiberglass/foam/fiberglass sandwich structure, the builder used a hot-wire cutter to slice the foam core to shape, then cover the core with epoxy resin and fiberglass cloth cut precisely to maintain strength at minimum weight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When the homebuilders began to fly their VariEzes, two problems immediately surfaced that involved weight and control of the airplane. Rutan surveyed the builders in April 1978 and discovered that the average, finished airplane was 14-23 kg (30-50 lb) heavier than specified in the plans. Some builders had disregarded Rutan's fundamental design philosophy-the idea of a simple, lightweight aircraft equipped to operate in daylight and clear weather. These builders had added heavy instrument packages to fly at night and in bad weather. In turn, this equipment required more complex, and heavier, electrical systems. Some VariEzes weighed so much that they could not safely carry a passenger."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The control issue was a serious problem that demanded a lot of intense work to fix quickly. Considerable precision was required to build the correct incidence and twist into the aft wing. Several builders reported that the first flights in their airplanes had required full roll input to maintain a wings-level attitude. Error in wing incidence and twist were overpowering the elevons mounted on the canard. Rutan decided to redesign the rear wing to incorporate ailerons but to keep the elevator control in the canard. He and his team completed this herculean task in about two weeks and rushed the changes to anxious builders."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Despite these difficulties, the VariEze became extremely popular and Rutan eventually sold about 3,000 sets of plans. Two hundred VariEzes were flying by 1980. In 1985, Rutan decided to stop selling plans for all Rutan airplanes. He had recently started a new company, Scaled Composites, but the effort required to run firms had quickly become onerous and Rutan reluctantly chose to terminate sales of plans to homebuilders. The Rutan Aircraft Factory continued to assist builders laboring on projects under way at the time of this decision."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Pilots flying N4EZ had clocked 700 flying hours when Doug Shane flew it from Rutan's shop at Mojave Airport, California, to Washington, D. C., and delivered the aircraft to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in 1986. This aircraft has a rich history. In the late 1970s, NASA undertook new research aimed at improving the safety of civil flying. NASA scientists and engineers carefully studied stall/spin accidents, then causing more fatalities than any other type of accident. The spin-resistant characteristics of the VariEze caught the agency's attention, so NASA flew Burt Rutan to Langley Field, Virginia, in the fall of 1977. During November, NASA sent a team of aerodynamics experts to Rutan's shop at Mojave Airport. NASA test pilots Jim Patton and Phil Brown, and engineer Don Hewes, spent several days flying N4EZ. They persuaded NASA to build two VariEzes for flight test and wind tunnel research."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Burt Rutan also used N4EZ during the early 1980s to test the effects of rain and heavy moisture on the laminar-flow properties of both the main wing and canard.

None of the conventional methods employed by the Luftwaffe to intercept the bombers seemed to work so the service began to explore unconventional means. The RLM Technical Office issued requirements for an inexpensive fighter made of non-essential materials that could defend important targets. Messerschmitt, Junkers, Heinkel, and Erich Bachem submitted proposals but RLM officials remained unenthusiastic about Bachem's design. They chose a more conventional offering from Heinkel but Bachem refused to give up. He sought the support of Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS (Nazi Party security forces). Himmler liked Bachem's proposal and signed an order to build 150 Natters using SS funds. It was now possible that the SS might develop an aircraft beyond the RLM's control so they placed their own order for 50 Natters and announced the official designation, Bachem Ba 349."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Bachem's design was simple and easy to build. Semi-skilled labor could construct one in about 1000 man-hours. The wings were plain rectangular wooden slabs without ailerons, flaps, or other control devices. The cruciform tail consisted of four fins and control surfaces. Deflecting these surfaces in various combinations controlled pitch, yaw, and roll, once the Ba 349 had reached sufficient speed to generate adequate airflow. Aerodynamic control was augmented by guide vanes connected to the four control surfaces. Bachem positioned each vane within the exhaust plume of the main engine, a Walter 109-509A rocket motor. This is the same basic engine used in the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet (also preserved in the NASM collection). Two liquid fuels combined inside the motor to generate thrust. When T-Stoff (a highly caustic solution of hydrogen peroxide and a stabilizing chemical) mixed with C-Stoff (a hydrazine hydrate/methanol/water mixture), combustion was spontaneous so extreme care was required to handle both chemicals. The Walter motor generated about 1,700 kg (3,740 lb) of thrust but a loaded Ba 349A weighed more than 1,818 kg (4,000 lb) so liftoff required more power."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Bachem got the extra thrust from four Schmidding 109-533 solid-fuel rocket motors that he bolted to the aft fuselage, two per side. Each motor produced 500 kg (1,100 lb) of thrust. At liftoff, all five motors ignited, generating about 3,700 kg (8,140 lb) of thrust. The resulting 1.6 to 1 thrust-to-weight ratio produced acceptable climb performance."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Natter operations were relatively simple and the following account describes a hypothetical mission. A 24 m (79 ft) tower guided the rocket plane during liftoff. The wingtips and lower fin fit inside guide rails to stabilize the aircraft until it cleared the tower. The flight controls remained locked in neutral position until the solid boosters burned out about 10 seconds into the flight. At burnout, explosive bolts blasted away the solids, the flight controls unlocked, and the Natter's 3-axis Patin autopilot began receiving steering commands from the ground via radio. The airplane continued climbing but the pilot could intercede at any time and take full control. Bachem calculated maximum climb rate at 11,563 m (37, 400 ft) meters per minute but flight tests did not confirm this figure."},{"label":"Summary","content":"American daylight bomber formations often approached a target at an altitude of 6,250 m (20,000 ft) to 9,375 m (30,000 ft). After the Natter had climbed even with the formation, the pilot took control, steering his Natter in close. At a range of about 1.6-3.2 kilometers (1-2 miles) from the formation, the Natter pilot jettisoned the nose cone and shotgun style, salvoed all 24 Henschel Hs 217 Föhn unguided rockets."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Rocket fuel would be nearly exhausted by now, so the pilot began to descend. At about 1,400 m (4500 ft), the pilot released his seat harness and fired a ring of explosive bolts to blow off the entire nose section. A parachute simultaneously deployed from the rear fuselage and the sudden deceleration literally threw the pilot from his seat. The pilot activated his own parachute after waiting a safe interval to clear the bits of falling Natter. Ground crews recovered the Walter motor to use again but the airframe was now scrap."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Bachem set up a factory to design and build his dream at Waldsee in the Black Forest. By November 1944, the first Natter was ready for tests configured as a motorless glider. A Heinkel He 111 bomber carried one to 18,000 ft and released it. The pilot found the aircraft easy to control. At 1000 m (3,200 ft), he fired the explosive bolts and the escape sequence worked as designed. A powered vertical launch failed on December 18 because of faulty ground equipment design. On December 22, the aircraft made its first successful launch with the solid fuel boosters only because the Walter motor was not ready. Ten more successful launches followed during the next several months. Early in 1945, the Walter engine arrived and the Natter launched successfully with a complete propulsion system on February 25, 1945, carrying a dummy pilot. The launch proved that the complete flight profile was workable. All went according to plan, including recovery of the pilot dummy and Walter rocket motor."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Now a man had to fly and the first test came on February 28.

No cause was determined but the ground crew may have failed to lock the canopy and it could have struck the pilot. Despite the tragedy, more pilots volunteered to fly and the Bachem team launched three flights in March."},{"label":"Summary","content":"With the end near, the Germans erected a battery of ten Natters at Kircheim near Stuttgart.

The aircraft was an imaginative solution to a desperate problem but World War II ended before the weapon saw combat. Dr. Werner von Baun first proposed the concept in 1939 but the Air Ministry (RLM) rejected it as \"unnecessary and unworkable.\" Bachem, an engineer with the Fieseler works, thought the idea had merit. He tried but failed to generate interest in several different proposals for a rocket interceptor."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During spring 1944, the Allied bombing offensive began taking a serious toll on the German war machine. None of the conventional methods employed by the Luftwaffe to intercept the bombers seemed to work so the service began to explore unconventional means. The RLM Technical Office issued requirements for an inexpensive fighter made of non-essential materials that could defend important targets. Messerschmitt, Junkers, Heinkel, and Erich Bachem submitted proposals but RLM officials remained unenthusiastic about Bachem's design. They chose a more conventional offering from Heinkel but Bachem refused to give up. He sought the support of Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS (Nazi Party security forces). Himmler liked Bachem's proposal and signed an order to build 150 Natters using SS funds. It was now possible that the SS might develop an aircraft beyond the RLM's control so they placed their own order for 50 Natters and announced the official designation, Bachem Ba 349."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bachem's design was simple and easy to build. Semi-skilled labor could construct one in about 1000 man-hours. The wings were plain rectangular wooden slabs without ailerons, flaps, or other control devices. The cruciform tail consisted of four fins and control surfaces. Deflecting these surfaces in various combinations controlled pitch, yaw, and roll, once the Ba 349 had reached sufficient speed to generate adequate airflow. Aerodynamic control was augmented by guide vanes connected to the four control surfaces. Bachem positioned each vane within the exhaust plume of the main engine, a Walter 109-509A rocket motor. This is the same basic engine used in the Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet (also preserved in the NASM collection). Two liquid fuels combined inside the motor to generate thrust. When T-Stoff (a highly caustic solution of hydrogen peroxide and a stabilizing chemical) mixed with C-Stoff (a hydrazine hydrate/methanol/water mixture), combustion was spontaneous so extreme care was required to handle both chemicals. The Walter motor generated about 1,700 kg (3,740 lb) of thrust but a loaded Ba 349A weighed more than 1,818 kg (4,000 lb) so liftoff required more power."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bachem got the extra thrust from four Schmidding 109-533 solid-fuel rocket motors that he bolted to the aft fuselage, two per side. Each motor produced 500 kg (1,100 lb) of thrust. At liftoff, all five motors ignited, generating about 3,700 kg (8,140 lb) of thrust. The resulting 1.6 to 1 thrust-to-weight ratio produced acceptable climb performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Natter operations were relatively simple and the following account describes a hypothetical mission. A 24 m (79 ft) tower guided the rocket plane during liftoff. The wingtips and lower fin fit inside guide rails to stabilize the aircraft until it cleared the tower. The flight controls remained locked in neutral position until the solid boosters burned out about 10 seconds into the flight. At burnout, explosive bolts blasted away the solids, the flight controls unlocked, and the Natter's 3-axis Patin autopilot began receiving steering commands from the ground via radio. The airplane continued climbing but the pilot could intercede at any time and take full control. Bachem calculated maximum climb rate at 11,563 m (37, 400 ft) meters per minute but flight tests did not confirm this figure."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"American daylight bomber formations often approached a target at an altitude of 6,250 m (20,000 ft) to 9,375 m (30,000 ft). After the Natter had climbed even with the formation, the pilot took control, steering his Natter in close. At a range of about 1.6-3.2 kilometers (1-2 miles) from the formation, the Natter pilot jettisoned the nose cone and shotgun style, salvoed all 24 Henschel Hs 217 Föhn unguided rockets."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rocket fuel would be nearly exhausted by now, so the pilot began to descend. At about 1,400 m (4500 ft), the pilot released his seat harness and fired a ring of explosive bolts to blow off the entire nose section. A parachute simultaneously deployed from the rear fuselage and the sudden deceleration literally threw the pilot from his seat. The pilot activated his own parachute after waiting a safe interval to clear the bits of falling Natter. Ground crews recovered the Walter motor to use again but the airframe was now scrap."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bachem set up a factory to design and build his dream at Waldsee in the Black Forest. By November 1944, the first Natter was ready for tests configured as a motorless glider. A Heinkel He 111 bomber carried one to 18,000 ft and released it. The pilot found the aircraft easy to control. At 1000 m (3,200 ft), he fired the explosive bolts and the escape sequence worked as designed. A powered vertical launch failed on December 18 because of faulty ground equipment design. On December 22, the aircraft made its first successful launch with the solid fuel boosters only because the Walter motor was not ready. Ten more successful launches followed during the next several months. Early in 1945, the Walter engine arrived and the Natter launched successfully with a complete propulsion system on February 25, 1945, carrying a dummy pilot. The launch proved that the complete flight profile was workable. All went according to plan, including recovery of the pilot dummy and Walter rocket motor."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Now a man had to fly and the first test came on February 28. Oberleutnant Lothar Siebert climbed into a Ba 349A, strapped in, and rocketed off the launch tower. At about 500 m (1600 ft), the Natter shed its canopy and headrest and the aircraft veered off and flew into the ground, killing Siebert. No cause was determined but the ground crew may have failed to lock the canopy and it could have struck the pilot. Despite the tragedy, more pilots volunteered to fly and the Bachem team launched three flights in March."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the end near, the Germans erected a battery of ten Natters at Kircheim near Stuttgart. Pilots stood alert day after day but no U. S. bombers flew into range. The U. S. Seventh Army overran the site but not before the Germans blew up all ten Natters and their launchers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"It is interesting to speculate about the Natter's potential effectiveness.

Curtiss, with assistance from Royal Navy engineer Lt. John Cyril Porte, further enhanced the ability of waterborne aircraft to get off the water by constructing a mid-way \"step\" on the bottom of the float or hull. Water has adhesive qualities, especially when running over a curved surface, and early seaplanes had difficulty getting \"unstuck\" from the water, especially in calm seas. The addition of the step helped break up the water flow under the hull enabling the flying boat to get airborne more easily. Curtiss also added breather tubes to the flying boat hull. These were small copper tubes that ran from the inside of the hull to the undersurface step to relieve the low pressure under the hull and assisted the aircraft in becoming airborne."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Among the Curtiss Model E Flying Boats produced in 1913 was one sold to Logan A. \"Jack\" Vilas of Chicago.

Rhoades."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gliding and soaring gained popularity in the United States from the early 1930s through the postwar years but the difficulties of getting a glider airborne put off many potential enthusiasts. Glider pilots had a variety of options available but all were relatively cumbersome and sometimes dangerous, and required other pilots, drivers, or ground personnel. The most convenient method was to take off in tow behind either an automobile or a powered aircraft. When gliding and soaring began in Germany shortly after World War I, groups of healthy people ran down hills and towed the motor-less aircraft into the air attached to elastic 'bungee' chords. Bungee launches were very popular in Europe but the wider availability of auto and airplane tows, and the hot and humid weather in North America, prevented this labor-intensive alternative from migrating to the New World. Powered winches also pulled gliders aloft but this technique could be risky and required a certain degree of pilot skill. It also demanded a skilled winch operator."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Once aloft, a pilot might elect to boldly depart the vicinity of the airport and proceed cross-country. The result was usually an offsite landing in a meadow or farm field. To return the aircraft to the home base required another considerable expenditure of group labor. A ground crew first disassembled the glider into manageable sections, then loaded the pieces aboard a special glider trailer and hauled them back by road. Glider enthusiasts spent more time preparing to fly, rather than actually flying, than any other group in aviation. The solution to this imbalance between fun and work was to motorize the glider and allow the pilot to self-launch. This idea appeared simple in theory but it proved more complicated in practice."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"A prospective designer of a practical motor glider had to overcome three obstacles. He first had to select a proper power plant. It must be strong enough to propel pilot and aircraft off the ground to altitudes high enough for safe soaring, yet not so powerful that the weight and size of the engine substantially subtracted from the glide-ratio. The second problem lay in streamlining the propeller and motor to reduce drag once the pilot silenced the engine and began to glide."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Glider enthusiasts in Germany first experimented with powered gliders during the early 1920s. Karl Plauth designed the two-seat D 8 \"Karl der Grosse\" in 1923. In the United States, William H. Bowlus and Ted Nelson built one of the first self-launching motorgliders in the United States. Bowlus had established himself as a master-craftsman in glider design and construction during the 1930s with two designs, the Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross and Senior Albatross (see NASM collection for both aircraft). Nelson had developed several of his own designs during the same period.

The Winnie Mae would then continue on its flight and land on a special metal-covered spruce landing skid glued to the fuselage. During these flights, Post wore a special pressure suit, the world’s first practical pressure suit and an important step on the road to space. The suit was the third type developed by Post and Russell S. Colley of B. F. Goodrich Company. It consisted of three layers: long underwear. an inner black rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer cloth contoured suit. A special pressure helmet was then bolted on the suit. It had a removable faceplate that Post could seal when he reached a height of 17,000 feet. The helmet had a special breathing oxygen system and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The suit could withstand an internal pressure of 7 psi. Bandolera-type cords prevented the helmet from rising as the suit was pressurized. A liquid oxygen container, consisting of a double-walled vacuum bottle, utilized the natural \"boil off\" tendencies of supercold liquid oxygen to furnish gaseous oxygen for suit pressurization and breathing purposes.

Pioneers 3 and 4 were launched by Juno II vehicles. Pioneer 3 was launched on 6 December 1958 and reached a maximum altitude of 102,300 kilometers (63,580 miles), never achieving escape velocity from the earth. Pioneer 4 was launched on 3 March 1959 and did achieve escape velocity, passing some 62,000 kilometers (37,300 miles) by the moon and then into orbit around the sun, the first American space probe to do so. The spacecraft shell was a conical structure made of gold-washed fiberglass painted with white stripes, which was a configuration used to establish passive thermal control. The cone was 23 centimeters (9 inches) in diameter at the base and 51 centimeters (20 inches) tall. It weighed 6.08 kilograms (13.4 pounds)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Instruments on board Pioneer 4 included two Geiger counters and a photoelectric sensor meant as a prototype trigger for a future television system. Pioneer 4 also had a mechanical despinning mechanism which consisted of weights attached to long wires wrapped around the base of the cone.

Anton type 213 Geiger counters were prepared by James Van Allen's team from the State University of Iowa for both Pioneer 3 and 4 and were integrated into a telemetry/antenna/battery pack and payload structure built by JPL. The Pioneer 4 counters had additional shielding and were designed to maximize dynamic range. Ground stations at Cape Canaveral, Mayaguez and Goldstone were augmented by the recently completed 250-foot fully steerable Jodrell Bank radio telescope, which was capable of picking up extremely faint signals from the craft out to a geocentric distance of 658,30 km (103 earth radii), over three times the lunar distance.

Armament on the F4B-1 consisted of two .30-caliber machine guns synchronized to fire through the propeller arc."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Following the success of the first model, the Navy contracted for forty-six improved versions in June 1930, with deliveries beginning in January of the next year. The F4B-2 differed in having a redesigned ring cowling, improved split-axle landing gear, and Frise ailerons. Maximum speed was increased to 298 kph (186 mph), and the airplane could carry four 56.2-kg (116-lb) bombs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Encouraged by the Navy's results with the XF4B-1, the Army placed an order for ten similar aircraft with the carrier hook deleted. The Army version was designated the P-12. The first P-12 was flown to Central America on a goodwill mission by then Captain Ira C. Eaker in February 1929. The next model, the P-12B, was an upgraded version with Frise ailerons and a shorter landing gear. Ninety were produced. In June 1930, the Army Air Corps contracted for 131 P-12C models, which incorporated the P-12B airframe with a ring cowl and a cross-axle landing gear. Although the last thirty-five of the order were identified D models, they were identical to the P-12C. The naval equivalent was the F4B-2."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While production of the F4B-2 was in progress, Boeing began development of a new version. Instead of the bolted, alloy-tube fuselage of the earlier design, the F4B-3 had an all-metal semi-monocoque fuselage. The two-spar, fabric-covered wings with corrugated metal control surfaces were retained. The engine was the Pratt & Whitney R-1340-10, which was fitted with a drag ring. The Navy contracted for seventy-five F4B-3s; the first airplane was delivered on Christmas Eve in 1931. Built for the Army as the P-12E, the new version represented Boeing's largest Army contract since the MB-3A in 1921. Of the 135 ordered, 110 were delivered as P-12Es. The remaining twenty-five were delivered as P-12Fs, employing Pratt & Whitney SR-1340G engines for increased high altitude performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The fourth and final version of the F4B series was the F4B-4. Essentially an F4B-3 with a broader chord fin and a larger headrest for an inflatable life raft, the F4B-4 was first ordered in April 1931, and the last of ninety-two aircraft were delivered on February 28, 1933. Twenty-one of these airplanes were assigned to the U.S. Marine Corps. The F4B-4 maintained the good flight characteristics of the earlier versions despite greater weight and increased power. Only when overloaded and at maximum speed did the F4B-4 exhibit any instability."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Total production of the F4B/P-12 reached 586; almost 350 were ordered by the Army. Two were sent to Thailand where one remains today on display in the Royal Thai Air Force Museum, and twenty-five were built for Brazil. Of these, only one ever saw combat. Model 281, from which the F4B-3 and P-12E were developed, was sold to China where it was shot down by the Japanese after downing two of its three attackers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The airplane in the NASM collection is one of the twenty-one F4B-4s built for the Marine Corps. The only difference from the standard Navy configuration is the absence of a tail hook. Number 9241 was shipped from the Boeing factory in Seattle on December 20, 1932, arriving nine days later at the North Island Air Station in San Diego, California. This F4B-4 was assigned as the number two aircraft in Marine Fighting Squadron 10, and served there until July 1933. All the F4B-4s of the squadron were transferred to VF-9M at Quantico, Virginia, where 9241 flew until the F4Bs were replaced by more modern Grumman F3F-2s. The airplane then served as a trainer until purchased by the Bureau of Air Commerce and was stricken from the Navy inventory on July 31, 1939. Shortly thereafter it was purchased by Bellanca Aircraft Corporation and later re-sold to private owners. Number 9241 was donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1959 by its last owner, Ray Hylan, of Rochester, New York. It is now in its former colors as airplane number 21 of Marine Fighting Squadron VF-9M."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400025508-0","title":"Napier-Halford Dagger Series II, H-24 Engine","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv97e7584a3-6a66-4aac-ab2e-46fe40988eb5","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Type: Reciprocating, 24 cylinders, Air cooled, Supercharged"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Power rating: 470 kW (630 hp) at 3,500 rpm"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Displacement: 16.8 L (1,027 cu in)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Bore and Stroke: 96.8 mm (3.8125 in.) x 95.3 mm (3.75 in.)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Weight: 587 kg (1,295 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"Frank B.

The Albatros Werke began to build airplanes in 1910. Early in the war, the firm focused on two-seat observation types. In 1916, in response to the fading superiority of the Fokker monoplane to the French Nieuport 11 and the British de Havilland D.H.2, the German government requested the nation's aircraft companies to produce a suitable replacement for the Fokker. Albatros Werke chief designer, Robert Thelen, with his assistants Gnaedig and Schubert, offered a remarkably advanced design, the Albatros D.I. It featured a streamlined semi-monocoque fuselage, with an almost fully-enclosed in-line Mercedes engine and the propeller spinner neatly contoured into the nose of the fuselage. The D.I was quickly modified into the very similar D.II, which had the upper wing repositioned slightly to improve visibility for the pilot. Both fighters entered front-line service in the fall of 1916 and immediately demonstrated strong advantages over their Allied counterparts. Powered by a 160-horsepower Mercedes engine and armed with two machine guns, the Albatros fighters used speed and firepower to overwhelm the lighter, more maneuverable Nieuports and D.H. 2s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Even before the success of the Albatros D.I and D.II was fully realized, Thelen was already developing an improved model. The Albatros D.III was introduced early in 1917 and it met with instant acceptance by the German pilots. It was easy to fly and was an effective combat aircraft. The principal design change was the use of a narrow-chord lower wing, similar to the sesquiplane wing arrangement of the agile Nieuport fighters. This increased maneuverability as well as improving the pilot's field of view. Initially, the narrow lower wing was susceptible to frequent failure in prolonged dives, but with reinforcement of the structure and improved workmanship, the problem was ameliorated. The Albatros D.III served with great success throughout the first half of 1917."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Beginning in mid-1917, however, with the introduction of the British S.E. 5 and the French Spad VII, German air superiority waned once again. Thelen was forced to refine the sleek Albatros design further in an effort to gain parity with the new Allied fighters. In the D.IV model, Thelen reverted to the equal-width upper and lower wings of the D.I and D.II. The nose was even more streamlined than the D.III and the rudder had a more rounded shape. An experimental geared version of the 160-horsepower Mercedes engine was fitted to the D.IV prototype. But despite its racy appearance, the performance of the D.IV was not up to that of the D.III, and the experimental geared engine was problem-ridden. Thus, no production run of the D.IV was ordered."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Albatros D.V returned to the sesquiplane wing design of the D.III. Initially it was powered by the same 160-horsepower Mercedes engine used in the D.III, but later it was replaced by an up-rated model that delivered approximately 180 horsepower. The major new innovation was the D.V's elliptical cross-section fuselage, compared to the flat-sided fuselage of the earlier models. Primarily because of changes in the nature of the construction of the elliptical fuselage, the D.V was approximately 32 kg (70 lb) lighter than the D.III, and this improved performance marginally. But hopes for the new version were soon undermined by a rash of upper-wing spar failures shortly after the D.V was introduced. To remedy the problem, the wing ribs and the spars were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va. Unfortunately, the necessary strengthening of the airframe made the overall weight of the D.Va 23 kg (50 lb) more than the D.III, negating the performance improvement of the newer model. The D.V and D.Va also continued to experience the same lower wing failure problems in a dive of the earlier D.III. A small auxiliary strut was added at the bottom of the outer wing struts to address the issue, but was not entirely successful. Even so, the D.Va remained in production until April 1918, when the superior Fokker D.VII appeared."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Approximately 4,800 Albatros fighters of all types were built during World War I.

One is at the Australian War Memorial Museum in Canberra, Australia, serial number D.5390/17. The other is in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The early history of the NASM Albatros is very sketchy. During the restoration of the airplane by NASM, the serial number D.7161/17 was discovered under several layers of paint on the fin. This places it in the final batch of 550 D.Vas built by the Albatros factory during the war. The last of these aircraft reached the front in April 1918. It is apparent, however, that the airplane is comprised of components from more than one Albatros. The individual wings show evidence of workmanship of different quality, suggesting that they were not produced at the same time and at the same place. Further, before restoration, there were straight crosses as well as the earlier Iron Cross national insignia on different components of the airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Another clue to the history of the NASM Albatros was revealed during restoration. The original layer of paint showed green and yellow stripes on the tail. This was the marking for the German squadron Jasta 46. This unit was formed at Graudenz on December 17, 1917, as part of Germany's Amerika Program, an effort to build up German strength rapidly and deliver a decisive blow to the West before American resources could be brought to bear for the Allies. Under the program, the number of German fighter units doubled. The inferred production date from the serial number of the NASM Albatros fits with the creation and equipping of Jasta 46 with Albatros fighters. Evidence that the NASM Albatros did see combat is damage from a bullet that passed through the right machine gun mount, penetrated the emergency fuel tank, and then lodged in the right magneto. The airplane was unlikely to have flown again as the fuel tank had not been repaired."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The distinctive personal marking of \"Stropp\" on the fuselage side remains a mystery. Some have suggested that stropp can be interpreted to mean a precocious or mischievous boy, but no record confirming this, or even with whom the marking was associated, has been found."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The history of the airplane for the remainder and immediate aftermath of the war remains unknown. The first record of the NASM Albatros in the United States is the presentation of the airplane to the De Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco on July 13, 1919, by Congressman Julius Kahn. It is unclear how Congressman Kahn became associated with the Albatros, but a label placed with the airplane at that time credited it as a gift from the French government. Some years later, NASM curator Paul Garber learned of the Albatros at the De Young Memorial Museum. On a trip to California in January 1947, he located the airplane and approached the museum about donating it to the Smithsonian. Garber was informed that it had recently been sold at auction for $500.00 to George K. Whitney, who planned to display it at Playland near Cliff House, a local San Francisco tourist stop. After Garber explained the importance of the historic aircraft to Whitney, he agreed to donate it to the Smithsonian, with the condition that the museum pay the packing and transportation costs. After a lengthy delay until funds were available, the Albatros was moved to the museum's temporary storage facility in Park Ridge, Illinois, in August 1949. It was brought to Washington, D.C., in 1952 and remained in storage until restoration began in January 1977. The complex and meticulous rebuilding of the NASM Albatros D.Va was completed in February 1979."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023263-0","title":"Indicator, Oil Temperature, Japanese Army","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9122d53c0-df6c-4b12-81c9-fa2f18930b95","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"52mm dia.; range 0-130 deg.c; WW2; two-position switch;from \"dinah"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022833-0","title":"Pitot Tube","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9df3286af-4285-4839-8947-11d69e2ca51d","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"190mm width, 200mm length; long slots for static pressure opening."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022040-0","title":"Curtiss CD-12 Prototype (Serial Number 1) V-12 Engine","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9976093b2-414e-4954-89c9-51c3430590c1","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Type: Reciprocating, V-type, 12 cylinders, water-cooled"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Power rating: 242 kW (325 hp) at 1,800 rpm"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Displacement: 18.8 L (1,145 cu in.)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Bore and Stroke: 114 mm (4.5 in.) x 152 mm (6 in.)"},{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Weight: 308 kg (680 lb)"},{"label":"Summary","content":"The CD-12 development history extended over several years, and involved a number of well regarded figures in the aircraft industry.

Tremendous enthusiasm for the airplane could not overcome a significant weakness in the design: the lack of a suitable engine. The ultimate failure of concept should not obscure the many original and innovative aspects of the design."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Few airplanes have fired the imagination of sport pilots like the build-it-at-home-from-a-kit BD-5. The designer, Jim Bede, announced that the airplane would deliver tremendous performance at a minimal cost in money to purchase and operate, and time and space to build. Bede's enthusiasm for the airplane led him to market it prematurely with a fatal flaw: the lack of a suitable engine. The ultimate failure of the original BD-5 concept should not obscure the original and innovative aspects of the design."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1970, Bede (pronounced 'bee-dee') had earned a reputation for designing and flying innovative, high-performance aircraft. Factories produced more than 1,700 examples of his BD-1 (production designation AA-1), the first light aircraft mass-produced using bonded (glued) metal construction. Soon the BD-2 followed with the ambitious design goal to fly non-stop around the world without refueling. Bede never made the flight but the project stirred considerable interest among designers and pilots. Much more successful was the kitplane BD-4, which he designed so that builders constructed it using a patented \"panel-rib\" process. Bede sold about 600 BD-4 kits in part because the aircraft could accommodate four people."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Bede began concentrating on the BD-5 concept as early as 1967 but the demands of other projects slowed the work. In 1970, he began selling slick brochures packed with colorful photographs, intricate drawings, and astonishing performance estimates. Word of the BD-5 quickly flashed throughout the community of amateur builders and enthusiasts. On February 24, 1971, Bede accepted the first $900 deposit to reserve a BD-5 kit for a prospective builder. Though promising a lot of bang per buck, years of hard and difficult work remained to make the BD-5 idea practical. The aircraft had not even flown, yet Jim Bede and the BD-5 were coming under increasing pressure from a hyper-enthusiastic market whose patience and reason was fast succumbing to demands for quick gratification."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The slick brochures presented a prototype with a sharp, smooth nose gracefully flowing back to an exotic vee-tail, which soon gave way to a conventional cruciform tail mounted at the back end of a miniscule single-seat fuselage barely 4 m (13 ft) long. Bede mounted the wings low and depending on the version, they spanned (4.3 m/14 ft 4 in span) on the BD-5A, or just over 6.4 m (21 ft) on the BD-5B. The 'A model appeared in most of the early brochures and other advertising but as development continued, it became apparent that the airplane flew much better with the longer wings. To move about on the ground, Bede fitted tiny, retractable, tricycle landing gear. He minimized the physical attributes of the BD-5 to increase performance with small engines and to reduce the cost to fabricate components. Small size appealed to many homebuilders who were loath to take on projects that required more building space than a garage or apartment. Bede designed the wings to separate quickly and easily from the fuselage. This feature allowed the builder to store the BD-5 at home rather than paying to rent a hanger at the airfield."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Interest in the BD-5 soared after company test, Les Berven, flew the prototype on 12 September 1971. By December, prospective builder-pilots had flooded the company with orders for 4,000 kits. As is standard practice within the amateur-built aircraft community, builders had to form, cut, drill, bond, and rivet a variety of raw materials provided by Bede's staff into a finished BD-5 according to a detailed set of instructions. To reduce building time, Bede technicians formed a few of the more critical parts with complex shapes, such as the fuselage skins. Jim Bede sold the first kits for $2,100 and estimated that after toiling about 300-400 hours, the average builder could be ready to fly. Many variables always influence such predictions so kit manufacturers wisely pad their estimates, however Bede's projection appeared remarkable because the airplane was not a simple design of modest performance, but rather a genuine thoroughbred that demanded a high degree of skill and precision to build and fly."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In the hands of a qualified pilot, the tiny BD-5 could become a star performer capable of a full range of aerobatic maneuvers. Nearly all who flew the airplane called the handling qualities delightful. Small size and careful design made the control pressures were very light but the characteristic was due also to Bede's use of stiff aluminum push-rods supported on ball bearings to all control surfaces with the pilot's control stick and rudder pedals. One pilot described how he simply 'thought' himself into a turn, with little or no awareness that sensation of manipulating the controls. Quite pleasant in the air, such light control pressures could be deadly on takeoff when inexperienced pilots moved the controls too abruptly and lost control. There was no fix for this characteristic and pilots new to flying the BD-5 received stern warnings to use extreme caution until they were familiar with the tiny movements required to fly the BD-5. Advertised as 322 kph (200 mph), maximum cruise speed was as impressive as the handling, the result of not only a very clean and streamlined configuration, but also the small size and low weight, about 270 kg (600 lb). It was said that the little airplane behaved equally well at the opposite end of the performance spectrum but the statement that the BD-5 could slow down to soar like a motor glider was certainly a stretch unless really extraordinary weather conditions were encountered. Bede also claimed that the power plant sipped just 4 gallons per hour of fuel to give the airplane sufficient range to fly about 1,610 km (1,000 miles) at an altitude of 4,256 m (14,000 ft)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Great handling, high-speed performance, and economical operation, all beautifully packaged! The BD-5 seemed to have it all, yet to excel in all these areas, a very special engine had to propel the kit plane. Such an engine did not exist. Bede had envisioned adapting one of the many two-cycle, air-cooled engine designs commonly used to power snowmobiles. His first engine was a 40 horsepower unit manufactured by Kiekhaefer Aeromarine that proved unreliable. Next he tried an engine manufactured in Germany by Hirth in versions that developed from 40 to 70 horsepower. After Hirth announced that the firm could not supply enough power plants to meet projected kit sales, the most difficult problem for BD-5 kit owners remained the engine. Bede tried motors from Polaris, Zenoah, Kawasaki, and others but never found an alternative able to withstand the unique demands of aircraft propulsion."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Most builders found the kits difficult to build. They had to fabricate complex parts including the drive system that transmitted power from the engine to the propeller. One owner eventually spent 7 years and $20,000 to finish his airplane. To meet demand, Bede announced a full production version designated the BD-5D, which he would certify and sell for $4,400 but none was built. The factory manufactured about 3,000 kits; however, customers bought less than 1,000. By the late 1970s, Bede had run out of time to save the BD-5. Budd Davisson summed up the disappointing outcome: \"Too much was said early in the game, promises were made, performance figures quoted and money taken. So, when things didn't go like clockwork, the BD buying public got a little bit ticked off.\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Those who had bought kits began to sell them for far less than they had paid, if they could find buyers. Hoping to generate cash, Bede dabbled briefly with a sailplane version, and his jet-powered BD-5 became popular at air shows but the dream to mass market the little kit plane ended in 1979 when Bede declared bankruptcy."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Jim Bede's BD-5 remained a compelling design in the new millennium as hardy souls managed to keep about 150 flying in 2002, thanks largely to entrepreneurs who formed companies to supply knowledge, experience, and critical hardware. During the mid-1970s, Keith Hinshaw organized Bede-Micro Aviation in San Jose, California, and focused the business on supplying a solution to the engine problem, and supplying parts and assistance to builders. A former BD-5 owner, Hinshaw and his staff worked out a nifty solution to the propulsion problem when they successfully adapted a turbo-charged Honda automobile engine to the aircraft. Bede-Micro also designed and sold parts and plans to strengthen the wings and the top of the rudder, improved the landing gear and flaps, and stretched the fuselage 12 cm (5 in) to accommodate a greater variety of engines."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On 11 September 1984, Peter K. Graichen and Albert C. Beckwith of Stow, Ohio, donated their BD-5 to the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum. Graichen had built begun to build the aircraft in 1972 and he finished six years and 5,000 working-hours later. To power the BD-5, he installed one of the Honda engines modified by Hinshaw's staff at Bede-Micro. The airplane was first flown on 21 October 1978 at Akron Municipal Airport. Pilots logged 9 hours of flying time before Graichen and Beckwith generously donated the airplane to the Museum in 1984."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022292-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Japanese Army, Type-100","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9dc831b25-5535-47ff-8de4-fa115c732694","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Pressure-operated black face w/white nos. 31/4 ins, 0-35 scale"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023309-0","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, Model 606","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9c10ae4d1-17d3-479d-9ad3-d7e7ff0aabc3","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"2-3/4 in.dia.; range 0-200amps; WW2"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023480-0","title":"Voltmeter / Ammeter, E-1","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d0373084-15ad-48c2-9ccd-88ac1820420b","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"3-1/4 in.dia;range 0-300 amps;pos.& neg. poles;black face;ww2"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022488-0","title":"Curtiss Robin J-1 Deluxe","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9fa620ddf-0788-4eec-86ed-c52d11ff5ded","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"108E.

Robins offered flight characteristics as straightforward as their appealing lines and modest performance. A distinctive feature (shared with Fairchild cabin monoplanes of the period) was side cockpit windows that ran almost to the floor."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The biplane dominated aviation until the mid-1920s when monoplane designs, featuring cleaner lines with less drag, began to appear. Then, in 1927, Charles Lindbergh's historic flight from New York to Paris showed the world that the era of the monoplane was truly at hand. His Ryan Spirit of St. Louis-like the Stinson SM, Bellanca Columbia, Fairchild FC-2, and Ford Tri-Motor-all featured a single high wing and fully enclosed cabin. The Robin, built to the same formula, was conventional in structure with a welded fuselage built of rugged steel tubing that was rectangular in cross section. Except for the cowling, the airplane was entirely fabric-covered. Orange with black trim was a common factory color scheme. More than 300 Robins were fitted with the surplus OX-5 and sold to the civil market at $4,000. Others were powered by the 170-hp Curtiss Challenger (a six-cylinder, twin-row radial engine that was less than satisfactory) and the excellent 165-hp Wright J-6-5 Whirlwind.

Coad, a government entomologist, conceived the idea that dusting the cotton industry's nemesis, the boll weevil, would be more efficient if it could be done from the air rather than from mule-drawn wagons. Initial trials with Curtiss Jenny biplanes convinced him that researchers were on the right track, but also highlighted the need for an aircraft specially designed for crop dusting. The Huff-Daland Manufacturing Company of Ogdensburg, New York received the contract to design and produce the Duster biplane which was completed in 1925. It was a derivative of a Huff-Daland military/commercial design, called the Petrel 5, which was used by the U.S. Navy both in landplane and seaplane versions. Fairchild Aerial Survey Company also used it for aerial photography."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Huff-Daland Duster was a fabric-covered, cantilever-winged biplane that was structurally designed so that it had none of the wing brace wires that were common of the biplane designs of that era. The fuselage and tail surfaces were made of welded steel tubing and the wings were single-piece units made of spruce and mahogany. The entire airplane, except for the area behind the engine, was fabric covered. The wing struts and landing gear were made of streamlined steel tubing. The landing gear was a conventional double-tripod split-axle type with 26x4 wire wheels and used Oleo struts for absorbing the landing loads. The dust hopper carried 800 pounds of calcium arsenate. Although some documentation says the Petrel 5's 200 hp Wright J-4 Whirlwind air-cooled 9-cylinder radial was replaced with a 400 hp Liberty 12 engine for the Duster, Delta officials said that their Dusters flew with the J-4B."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1923, C .E.

Three years later the Huff-Daland Duster Company relocated to Monroe, Louisiana. Because of the seasonal nature of the crop dusting business, Woolman began to operate in Peru in 1926 during the North American off-season, dusting more than 50,000 acres in Peruvian valleys in 1927. He expanded their business during 1928 by carrying passengers and freight in a Fairchild FC-2 and other aircraft, in association with Peruvian Airways Corporation, however the chronically unstable South American political climate caused him to abandon crop dusting and sell out this portion of the air service business."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Woolman returned to the U.S. in 1928 and found the Huff-Daland Duster Company in financial difficulty. Huff-Daland Airplanes, then part of Keystone Aircraft, wanted to divest itself of Huff-Daland Duster so Woolman took it over, and, with the help of some Monroe investors, founded a new company, Delta Air Service, headquartered there. Woolman became senior Vice President and General Manager and planned to carry passengers and freight as well as continuing in the crop dusting business. They inaugurated their passenger and mail service with a route between Dallas and Jackson, Mississippi, flying six-passenger Travel Air 6000s. Thus began what was eventually to become Delta Air Lines. Woolman became president of Delta in 1945 and was appointed Chairman of the Board in 1965.

This aircraft, as the first of its type in the United States, generated considerable interest in commercial and governmental circles. It validated Pitcairn's interest in the new category of aircraft and inspired other American pioneers to enter the field. The C.8W deserves recognition as the progenitor of the American gyroplane and as the first successful rotary-wing aircraft to fly in the United States."},{"label":"Summary","content":"The word \"Autogiro\" is a proprietary name coined by Juan de la Cierva. His designs were the first aircraft to fall in the gyroplane category. Nonetheless, nearly all gyroplanes built from the 1920s through to the end of World War Two became commonly known as \"autogiros\" (or the more generic \"autogyros\"), regardless of the manufacturer. A gyroplane is an aircraft that derives most, if not all, of its lift from the unpowered autorotation of a horizontally mounted rotor or rotors. Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical \"jump\" takeoffs."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Most of the early gyroplanes were similar in layout to single-engine low-winged monoplanes, with the exception of the rotor mounted on a pylon in front of the cockpit that provided the primary source of lift during slow-speed flight. They employed standard airplane-type control surfaces (elevator, aileron, and rudder) and the rotor blades all maintained a fixed pitch. The stubby monoplane wing did not serve primarily for the generation of lift. Rather, it was a convenient means of mounting the ailerons and providing stability. It also had the unintended benefit of making the aircraft appear more conventional to skeptical airplane operators who were doubtful about flying without fixed wings."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Cierva constructed his first Autogiro, the coaxial rotor C.1, in 1920. As the rotors on the C.1 autorotated at different speeds, rendering the aircraft incapable of controlled flight, he decided to switch to a single rotor design. However, the abortive first flight of the new aircraft revealed a problem that he had not considered. As the Autogiro began to gain speed during its takeoff roll, the rotor blade that was turning towards the front of the aircraft received the benefit of additional airspeed because of the forward motion of the Autogiro. However, the blade retreating towards the rear of the autogiro suffered a loss in its airspeed relative to the oncoming air for the same reason. The net effect was a difference in airspeeds of the two blades that naturally caused asymmetry of lift between the two sides of the rotor disc (as lift is a function of airspeed). In turn, this resulted in the Autogiro rolling into the retreating blade side. A subsequent Cierva Autogiro also suffered the same problem and failed to take off successfully."},{"label":"Summary","content":"In 1922, Cierva conceived an inspired solution to his problem. By incorporating a hinge that allowed each blade to \"flap\" independently at its root, he developed a rotor that equalized lift amongst all of the blades, regardless of whether the Autogiro was flying fast or slow. When the advancing blade generated additional lift because of its higher velocity, the flapping hinge allowed it to rise, which effectively reduced the angle of attack of the blade, thus reducing its lift. On the other side of the rotor, the flapping hinge allow the retreating blade to descend with its reduced lift, which effectively increased its angle of attack, thus generating more lift. This breakthrough was not only an essential component for the Autogiro - it was also necessary for the development of the practical helicopter."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Cierva's first successful Autogiro (and the first successful rotary-wing aircraft of any kind), the C.4, took flight on January 17, 1923 at Getafe airfield in Madrid, Spain. Over the next three years, Cierva made progressive improvements that resulted in the standard monoplane configuration for gyroplanes that remained in use until the mid-1930s. The greatest improvements came in the design of the rotor blades and the hinges, both of which would later prove essential for helicopters."},{"label":"Summary","content":"Cierva constructed his first C.8 model, the C.8V, in close association with A.V. Roe & Co. Ltd. (commonly known as Avro). The airframe was based on the fuselage of the Avro 552A, a variant of the venerable Avro 504 biplane. The most innovative component of the C.8V was its new four-bladed cable-braced rotor that incorporated drag hinges to reduce the stresses on the blades. The \"V\" in the model designation indicated the type of engine used in the variant - in this case, a Wolseley Viper. Cierva constructed six different C.8 configurations, all of which were experimental testbeds built to test improvements in autogiro technology before a production model, the C.19, was to appear in 1929. Given the limited knowledge of rotary wing aerodynamics of the time and the necessity of relying on trial-and-error methods, it is not surprising that Cierva constructed two dozen experimental autogiros before he completed a model worthy of production."},{"label":"Summary","content":"The most powerful of the six C.8s constructed was the two-seat C.8W fitted with a 220 horsepower Wright Whirlwind J-5. Cierva had equipped the aircraft with an American engine at the request of its buyer, Harold Pitcairn. As a teenager, Pitcairn had developed a fascination with the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft and had avidly followed news of Cierva's progress. In 1924, he had established himself in the aircraft manufacturing industry by building rugged biplanes, one of which, the PA-5 Mailwing (see NASM Collection), was to gain a legendary reputation amongst pilots who flew the nascent airmail routes. Nonetheless, Pitcairn pursued his dream to enter the then highly dubious field of rotary-wing aviation. In 1925 and 1926 he traveled to England for discussions with Cierva about either license-building Autogiros or using them as the basis of his own helicopter designs. While there with his engineer, Agnew Larsen, Pitcairn viewed film footage of the aircraft in operation. They observed that, while the Autogiro was capable of landing in short distances within a confined space, it also required considerable amounts of high-speed taxiing to build up sufficient rotor rpm to take off. Clearly, the ability to land short was of little value without the capability to take off from the same terrain. Nonetheless, Pitcairn remained interested, and in the summer of 1928 he returned to England and flew in the C.8, which greatly impressed him. A rope sling pulled by a ground crew spun up the rotor of the C.8 to near takeoff rpm, which meant that less taxiing was required before a takeoff of only (100 ft). Pitcairn decided to purchase one of the experimental Cierva C.8s as a testbed for his own company's rotary wing program."},{"label":"Summary","content":"European engines turned counter-clockwise when viewed from the rear, while the American Wright Whirlwind J-5 turned clockwise, which caused Pitcairn some apprehension over its affects on rotor rpm. After Cierva confirmed that this would not be an issue, Pitcairn agreed to purchase a new C.8 with the Wright engine. On December 11, 1928, the C.8W arrived in the United States onboard the S.S. Aquitania. Pitcairn planned to have the Autogiro make its flight on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Wright brother's first powered flight, on December 17, at his Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania airfield. However, he was conservative when dealing with the experimental testing of the newly reassembled aircraft and was extremely anxious that all should go well on the first flight. Thus, not until December 18, would the C.8W perform the first flight of a gyroplane in the United States, with Cierva test pilot, Arthur \"Dizzy\" Rawson at the controls. Pitcairn himself flew the aircraft the following day. Whatever doubts Pitcairn had concerning the potential of rotary-wing aircraft evaporated as he completely reorganized his company to support autogiro production.

One problem was that rotor flapping was unchecked, so that at speeds greater than 161 kph (100 mph) it was possible for the rotor to strike the fuselage - with catastrophic results. By the end of 1929, a three-degree reduction in the angle of incidence of the autogiro's fixed wing reduced this hazard significantly by altering the attitude of the aircraft in flight. Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in).

The C.8W did much to publicize the Autogiro during the development of Pitcairn's initial design, the PCA-1 (see NASM Collection). By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration.

One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s."},{"label":"Summary","content":"In 1930, the National Aeronautic Association awarded Pitcairn the prestigious Collier Trophy because of his pioneering flights in the C.8W and the successful Americanization of the Autogiro in the form of the PCA-1. After the C.8W finished its useful life as a testbed upon completion of the PCA-1 series of experimental Autogiros, it lay dormant for a brief time. Pitcairn then decided to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution's repository of historic aircraft at the urging of Paul Garber, who attended to the Smithsonian's aeronautics collection. The last flight of the C.8W occurred on July 22, 1931, when Pitcairn test pilot Jim Ray landed the aircraft on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian \"Castle\" after a 209-kilometer (130-mile) flight from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles Abbott, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, personally accepted it into the national collection. The aircraft currently awaits restoration and display. Harold Pitcairn stated at the presentation that \"the time is fast approaching when the air will hold a vast number of similar but more perfected machines, all engaged in the everyday social and commercial activities of our people.\" The gyroplane was unquestionably a safe and economical means of solving the short takeoff and landing problem that had troubled aeronautical engineers for decades. However, the type's limited payload and low airspeeds usually made it a poor substitute for conventional airplanes in the eyes of most operators.

This aircraft, as the first of its type in the United States, generated considerable interest in commercial and governmental circles. It validated Pitcairn's interest in the new category of aircraft and inspired other American pioneers to enter the field. The C.8W deserves recognition as the progenitor of the American gyroplane and as the first successful rotary-wing aircraft to fly in the United States."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The word \"Autogiro\" is a proprietary name coined by Juan de la Cierva. His designs were the first aircraft to fall in the gyroplane category. Nonetheless, nearly all gyroplanes built from the 1920s through to the end of World War Two became commonly known as \"autogiros\" (or the more generic \"autogyros\"), regardless of the manufacturer. A gyroplane is an aircraft that derives most, if not all, of its lift from the unpowered autorotation of a horizontally mounted rotor or rotors. Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical \"jump\" takeoffs."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Most of the early gyroplanes were similar in layout to single-engine low-winged monoplanes, with the exception of the rotor mounted on a pylon in front of the cockpit that provided the primary source of lift during slow-speed flight. They employed standard airplane-type control surfaces (elevator, aileron, and rudder) and the rotor blades all maintained a fixed pitch. The stubby monoplane wing did not serve primarily for the generation of lift. Rather, it was a convenient means of mounting the ailerons and providing stability. It also had the unintended benefit of making the aircraft appear more conventional to skeptical airplane operators who were doubtful about flying without fixed wings."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Cierva constructed his first Autogiro, the coaxial rotor C.1, in 1920. As the rotors on the C.1 autorotated at different speeds, rendering the aircraft incapable of controlled flight, he decided to switch to a single rotor design. However, the abortive first flight of the new aircraft revealed a problem that he had not considered. As the Autogiro began to gain speed during its takeoff roll, the rotor blade that was turning towards the front of the aircraft received the benefit of additional airspeed because of the forward motion of the Autogiro. However, the blade retreating towards the rear of the autogiro suffered a loss in its airspeed relative to the oncoming air for the same reason. The net effect was a difference in airspeeds of the two blades that naturally caused asymmetry of lift between the two sides of the rotor disc (as lift is a function of airspeed). In turn, this resulted in the Autogiro rolling into the retreating blade side. A subsequent Cierva Autogiro also suffered the same problem and failed to take off successfully."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1922, Cierva conceived an inspired solution to his problem. By incorporating a hinge that allowed each blade to \"flap\" independently at its root, he developed a rotor that equalized lift amongst all of the blades, regardless of whether the Autogiro was flying fast or slow. When the advancing blade generated additional lift because of its higher velocity, the flapping hinge allowed it to rise, which effectively reduced the angle of attack of the blade, thus reducing its lift. On the other side of the rotor, the flapping hinge allow the retreating blade to descend with its reduced lift, which effectively increased its angle of attack, thus generating more lift. This breakthrough was not only an essential component for the Autogiro - it was also necessary for the development of the practical helicopter."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Cierva's first successful Autogiro (and the first successful rotary-wing aircraft of any kind), the C.4, took flight on January 17, 1923 at Getafe airfield in Madrid, Spain. Over the next three years, Cierva made progressive improvements that resulted in the standard monoplane configuration for gyroplanes that remained in use until the mid-1930s. The greatest improvements came in the design of the rotor blades and the hinges, both of which would later prove essential for helicopters."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Cierva constructed his first C.8 model, the C.8V, in close association with A.V. Roe & Co. Ltd. (commonly known as Avro). The airframe was based on the fuselage of the Avro 552A, a variant of the venerable Avro 504 biplane. The most innovative component of the C.8V was its new four-bladed cable-braced rotor that incorporated drag hinges to reduce the stresses on the blades. The \"V\" in the model designation indicated the type of engine used in the variant - in this case, a Wolseley Viper. Cierva constructed six different C.8 configurations, all of which were experimental testbeds built to test improvements in autogiro technology before a production model, the C.19, was to appear in 1929. Given the limited knowledge of rotary wing aerodynamics of the time and the necessity of relying on trial-and-error methods, it is not surprising that Cierva constructed two dozen experimental autogiros before he completed a model worthy of production."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The most powerful of the six C.8s constructed was the two-seat C.8W fitted with a 220 horsepower Wright Whirlwind J-5. Cierva had equipped the aircraft with an American engine at the request of its buyer, Harold Pitcairn. As a teenager, Pitcairn had developed a fascination with the possibilities of rotary-wing aircraft and had avidly followed news of Cierva's progress. In 1924, he had established himself in the aircraft manufacturing industry by building rugged biplanes, one of which, the PA-5 Mailwing (see NASM Collection), was to gain a legendary reputation amongst pilots who flew the nascent airmail routes. Nonetheless, Pitcairn pursued his dream to enter the then highly dubious field of rotary-wing aviation. In 1925 and 1926 he traveled to England for discussions with Cierva about either license-building Autogiros or using them as the basis of his own helicopter designs. While there with his engineer, Agnew Larsen, Pitcairn viewed film footage of the aircraft in operation. They observed that, while the Autogiro was capable of landing in short distances within a confined space, it also required considerable amounts of high-speed taxiing to build up sufficient rotor rpm to take off. Clearly, the ability to land short was of little value without the capability to take off from the same terrain. Nonetheless, Pitcairn remained interested, and in the summer of 1928 he returned to England and flew in the C.8, which greatly impressed him. A rope sling pulled by a ground crew spun up the rotor of the C.8 to near takeoff rpm, which meant that less taxiing was required before a takeoff of only (100 ft). Pitcairn decided to purchase one of the experimental Cierva C.8s as a testbed for his own company's rotary wing program."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"European engines turned counter-clockwise when viewed from the rear, while the American Wright Whirlwind J-5 turned clockwise, which caused Pitcairn some apprehension over its affects on rotor rpm. After Cierva confirmed that this would not be an issue, Pitcairn agreed to purchase a new C.8 with the Wright engine. On December 11, 1928, the C.8W arrived in the United States onboard the S.S. Aquitania. Pitcairn planned to have the Autogiro make its flight on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Wright brother's first powered flight, on December 17, at his Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania airfield. However, he was conservative when dealing with the experimental testing of the newly reassembled aircraft and was extremely anxious that all should go well on the first flight. Thus, not until December 18, would the C.8W perform the first flight of a gyroplane in the United States, with Cierva test pilot, Arthur \"Dizzy\" Rawson at the controls. Pitcairn himself flew the aircraft the following day. Whatever doubts Pitcairn had concerning the potential of rotary-wing aircraft evaporated as he completely reorganized his company to support autogiro production. His first step was to acquire the American patent rights to Cierva's innovations and to manage and license them under the direction of the Pitcairn-Cierva Autogiro Company of America.

The XH-44 was also the first helicopter to fly successfully with all-metal blades and a rigid rotor. Hiller used the counter-rotating coaxial configuration to distinguish his designs from Sikorsky's single main rotor designs that dominated the helicopter industry in the mid-1940s."},{"label":"Summary","content":"The first tie-down tests of the XH-44 took place on his parents' driveway and the initial flight tests occurred at the University of California at Berkeley's football stadium, where Hiller was a student. He initially tested the XH-44 with amphibious floats in his family's swimming pool. Up-scaled coaxial Hiller designs failed to sell, but his company prospered with the introduction of the popular UH-12 single rotor model."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller XH-44 \"Hiller-Copter\""},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The fourth American company to begin mass production of helicopters was started by a brilliant and astute teenager, Stanley Hiller, Jr. His remarkable talent for business and inventiveness soon resulted in the XH-44. This coaxially configured twin-rotor rotorcraft was unique among American designs of the time, and although it was never mass-produced, it served its purpose by establishing Hiller Helicopters as a capable competitor in the nascent helicopter market."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller's interest in helicopters began at the age of sixteen in 1941. He was already running a successful enterprise that manufactured gas-powered model racecars. When the United States entered World War Two, Hiller converted his production line to C-47 window frames. By 1942, he had progressed far enough on his helicopter designs to form a new company, Hiller Aircraft, to begin construction on what was to become the XH-44. Hiller and his small group of experienced engineers and craftsmen had completed the first components for the small steel-tube and fabric-covered helicopter by December 1942. As had happened in the construction of Frank Piasecki's PV-2 (see NASM collection), limited financial resources and wartime shortages and restrictions meant that the staff had to scrounge or manufacture almost all their own components. Hiller also selected the same Franklin 90 hp engine (de-rated to 65 hp) to power the X-44 that Piasecki used in the PV-2. Unfortunately, the engine was not commercially available, and Hiller had to plead his case before several government agencies before one was made available to him. The engine was installed in late 1943, and testing began immediately."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The XH-44 differed dramatically in appearance from other helicopters developed during this period, because it employed two rotors, one stacked above the other on a single mast, and turning in opposite directions. Hiller had selected this unusual coaxial configuration for several reasons. The design was already proven in what can be regarded as the first practical helicopter, the Bréguet-Dorand Laboratory Gyroplane, which first flew in 1935. While the mechanism that allowed the rotors to turn in opposite directions was somewhat complex, it allows other weight-consuming components to be eliminated. Direction control was accomplished through cyclic pitch control as on most other helicopters."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In a single rotor helicopter, hinges must be incorporated to allow the blades to flap cyclically to assist in maintaining the same lift on the advancing side of the rotor disc as on the retreating side. On a coaxial helicopter each rotor counteracts the differential lift created on the other, and eliminates the potential loss of control because of retreating-blade stall. Also, as torque is cancelled, out there is no need for a tail rotor that robs a considerable percentage of engine horsepower. The absence of the tail boom, as well as the tail rotor and its transmission, results in considerable weight savings and reduces drag. The greatest penalty for coaxial helicopters comes from the requirement to have very strong \"rigid\" rotor blades to eliminate flapping which could bring the rotors into contact with each other. As a result, Hiller produced the first practical all-metal blades. These blades held up far better than those of Hiller's competitors, which were made largely of wood and covered with fabric. This resulted in lengthy manufacturing times, difficulty in balancing, and severe quality control problems. The coaxial configuration did have some defects, including poor directional control in forward flight and yaw control reversal in autorotations."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Hiller's decision to develop coaxial helicopters over single rotor types was also grounded in sound business considerations. Hiller realized that it would be very difficult to compete with Sikorsky and his imitators who possessed far greater resources, so he used the novelty of the coaxial design to attract attention and investors. One of the XH-44's great selling points as a home-based commuter aircraft was the absence of a highly dangerous tail rotor."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first engine run-up inside of Hiller's workshop was so successful that it sucked the skylights from the ceiling. Test flying was a slow and tedious process, because Hiller did not have any prior flight experience, and had to teach himself to fly the XH-44 while test flying it. During this process, the XH-44 was securely tethered, though on the first flight test, made in the driveway of Hiller's family residence, the tether was not adjusted properly and the helicopter tipped over resulting in minor damage. Subsequent testing was completed in the University of California at Berkeley's football stadium. On July 4 1944, Hiller flew the bright yellow craft freely for the first time in the stadium. A public demonstration followed on August 30, 1944 in San Francisco. This event and others like it successfully attracted outside investment, primarily in the form of Henry Kaiser, a wealthy Seattle ship-builder. The infusion of Kaiser's capital allowed Hiller to further refine the XH-44."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The biggest improvement on the Hiller-copter was a redesign of the rotor mast that allowed each two-rotor set to teeter, resulting in smoother handling and improved aerodynamic efficiency. Another change was the incorporation of a new, more powerful engine. By late 1945, Hiller felt the XH-44 testbed had been refined to the level that warranted construction of a new model, the X-2-235, in the hope that this design would lead to an order. No contracts were forthcoming but a refined version, the UH-4, was prepared for production as a commuter aircraft. Unfortunately, the personal aircraft boom that had been forecast for the postwar period did not materialize, and Hiller began to work on a more conventional utilitarian design."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While Hiller was clearly attached to the coaxial configuration, the development of a highly effective stabilization device known as the rotormatic system led to his abandonment of the type. The rotormatic components revolutionized helicopter stability, but the mechanism was adaptable to a coaxial rotor system. Hiller made the decision to adopt the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration for his next design the UH-12. This highly successful helicopter was to have the longest production run in history. However, the Hiller Aircraft Company continued to pursue advanced helicopter technology, focusing largely on small lightweight designs such as the foldable YROE rotorcycle (see NASM collection), and the X-18 tilt-wing. The coaxial design has since been abandoned by American manufacturers, but the Russian Kamov design group manufactured a number of the type, beginning at the height of the cold war and continuing through to the present day. These designs proved invaluable as their lack of a tail boom and rotor allowed the relatively large helicopters, used largely for anti-submarine warfare, to be easily stowed on a wide variety of naval vessels."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rotor Diameter:7.62 m (25 ft)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Fuselage Length:4.06 m (13 ft 4 in)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Height:2.74 m (9 ft)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Weight:Empty, 564 kg (1,244 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gross, 658 kg (1,450 lb)"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Engine:Lycoming, 125 hp"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"References and Further Reading:"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Labermont, Paul.

Luscombe was somewhat influenced by the Belgian Delmonty-Poncelet Limousine, a high-wing monoplane with a side-by-side enclosed cabin and the reverse curve rear fuselage lines that were to become one of the signature identifier features of the Monocoupes. Luscombe founded Central States Aero Company and hired Clayton Folkerts, a young self-taught designer. In 1928, the Mono 22 was the first light aircraft awarded an Aircraft Type Certificate (number 22) and in 1930 it was fitted with a Velie M-5 engine to become the Model 70. Central States Aero Company became Mono Aircraft, Inc., of Moline, Illinois, a subsidiary of the Velie Motors Company, and the Model 113 and the Model 90 followed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Model 110 was basically a Model 90 with a 110 hp Warner Scarab radial engine. The Model 110 Special, a clipped-wing version of the 110, grew out of racing pilot Johnny Livingston's desire to have a faster aircraft for the National Air Races. In 1931 his 110 was streamlined with fairings and wheel pants, and in 1932 Livingston asked Monocoupe to shorten the wingspan from the standard 32 feet to 20 feet, reduce the size and shape of the tail, and install a larger 145 hp Warner Scarab engine. The factory shortened the wingspan to just over 23 feet, retaining sufficient wing area to sustain safe flight during high-speed pylon turns. The changes improved the speed from 150 mph to 220 mph. Over several years, a total of ten Specials emerged, seven were built or modified by the factory, and three were modified by homebuilders."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Monocoupe 110 Special Little Butch, N36Y, was built at the factory in Melbourne, Florida, and test flown on February 3, 1941, by then-Monocoupe president Clare Bunch (Don Luscombe had left the company in 1933). The original base color of the airplane was Monocoupe Blue with an ivory trim. W. J. Coddington bought the aircraft on March 5, 1941, but severely damaged the airplane in a landing accident and returned it to the factory for repairs and resale. Guy Gully of Farrell, Pennsylvania, bought the aircraft on November 16, 1941, but had an accident and sold it to J. D. Reed of Houston, Texas, on August 3, 1943. Reed sold it on March 16, 1944 to W.W. \"Woody\" Edmondson of Lynchburg, Virginia, who named it Little Butch because of its bulldog-like appearance. Edmondson initially used the airplane for transportation between airports in Virginia and North Carolina where he operated government-sponsored pilot flight training programs during the war. In 1946 he re-entered the airshow circuit and installed a Warner 185 hp Super Scarab. This engine had a pressure carburetor for inverted flying and had a Koppers Aeromatic controllable pitch propeller. He often flew two or three air shows a day all scheduled close to Lynchburg so that he could fly, in his business suit, from one to another."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"One day Edmondson severely tested the structural integrity of the airplane by making a high-speed inverted pass and pulling up into a series of vertical rolls. This maneuver always subjected the aircraft to severe negative \"g\" loading conditions for which the airplane was not originally designed. It went into a series of uncontrollable snap rolls and ended up inverted at about 2,000 feet. Edmondson recovered control but then noticed that the right wing struts had an elbow bend of several inches in them. He reinforced the struts by nesting the next size struts within the existing size streamlined tubing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1946 and 1947 at the Miami Air Manuevers, Edmondson placed second in the aerobatics competition to Bevo Howard in his Bucker Jungmeister, which is also in the NASM collection, but he won in 1948 when the first International Aerobatics Championships were held. Sponsored by Gulf Oil Corporation, he continued to use N36Y on the air-show circuit throughout the east and midwest until 1951. Edmondson sold the airplane to Johnny Foyle, an air show pilot of South Boston, Virginia, on August 22, 1960, who twice flipped the airplane over on landings. Foyle was killed in another airplane accident and John McCulloch, an Eastern Airlines captain from Naples, Florida, bought N36Y on June 18, 1965.

Wishing to preserve this historic and rare airplane, he asked Ken Hyde of Warrenton, Virginia, to restore the aircraft to Edmondson's red and white paint scheme. The airplane flew again in October 1974 and it was then lent to the Shannon Air Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia.

Pitts began with an idea for an aerobatic aircraft that would defy gravity and be crisp on the controls. Rather than the larger pre-war biplanes, Pitts wanted something smaller that would climb, roll, and change attitude much more quickly. Instead of a large radial engine, Pitts built his aircraft around the new smaller and lighter horizontally-opposed engines. The swept wing allowed for access and center of gravity (CG) factors and made snap rolls snap more sharply. The resulting Pitts Special was revolutionary because of its small size, light weight, short wingspan, and extreme agility."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The prototype, S-1, was wrecked about two years after its first flight.

Many nosewheel strut failures delayed the transition to full operational status but the first airplanes flew combat missions in the Pacific not long after the American entry into World War II. On June 4, 1942, four Army Air Corps Marauders defending Midway island attacked Japanese aircraft carriers with torpedoes but failed to score hits. It was soon obvious that the B-25 Mitchell required less runway for takeoff and had greater range than the B-26 so U. S. Army Air Force (AAF) planners shifted all Marauders to Africa and the European Theater of Operations. The Mitchell became the preferred type in the Pacific. The 319th BG became the first Marauder outfit sent to England. During a familiarization flight, one ex-Tokyo raider crashed and the Group CO (commanding officer) and a Squadron CO became lost over France and were shot down and killed. During this mission, 18 men died, four aircraft were destroyed, and four damaged. The Army Air Forces sent Marauders on to North Africa after the Allies invaded that continent in November 1942. By the 21st of that month, the last 319th B-26 had arrived in Algeria. Out of 57 bombers that left the U. S., only 17 made it to Africa. On December 4, the new 319th Bombardment Group CO flew his first mission with the acting CO. The B-26 was hit by heavy anti-aircraft fire over the target and crashed. All survived and became POWs (prisoners of war). On December 15, the 12th Bomber Command CO, Col. Charles Phillips flew as guest pilot aboard a B-26 flown by a Squadron CO. This bomber was downed by anti-aircraft fire and all aboard perished. Such tragic missions were common during these initial stages of B-26 operations."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Early Marauders were particularly vulnerable after damage to the hydraulic system.

However, three days later the second mission took a disastrous turn. Eleven Marauders flew to Ijmuiden, Holland, to knock out a power station that they had failed to hit three days earlier. Flying the same route, in one of the costliest missions of the war, ten bombers were lost and one aborted. But as time went on, the Marauders were to redeem themselves and achieve a record of successes that more than compensated for earlier shortcomings. In June military planners ordered a halt to low-altitude bombing. Henceforth, all medium bombers would fly at medium altitudes, about 3,000 m (10,000 ft). During July 1943, the 3rd Bomb Wing flew the first Marauder missions without losses, thanks largely to escorting Spitfires that were employed in a 4 to 1 ratio of fighters to bombers. In fact the fighters could order the bombers to scrub a mission if conditions became too unfavorable. Marauders also operated in the Mediterranean and made their first mission on June 5, 1943. The 319th BG pioneered 3-ship and later 6-ship abreast formation takeoffs while operating from Decimomannu, Sardinia, during October 1943. During February 1944, the 319th and 320th bombed the Abbey di Monte Cassino. The first Marauder to reach 100 missions, \"Hell's Belle II,\" flew with the 319th BG and completed this milestone during May 1944.

He was born in 1854, and after a stint as a brakeman on the Illinois railroad as a youth, he joined the circus as an acrobat. One of the circus attractions was a balloon with which Baldwin ascended seated on a trapeze suspended beneath. He made his first trip aloft in 1875. Soon he enhanced the act by performing acrobatics on the trapeze at several hundred feet, which, by 1885, led to parachute jumps from the balloon. His successful daring quickly led to a world tour, including a special performance before the Prince of Wales in London. Baldwin's manager for the tour billed him as \"Captain\" Baldwin, a nickname by which he would be known from then on."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By the turn of the twentieth century, Baldwin's interest in aviation expanded from free balloons to dirigibles. Between 1900 and 1908, he built a number of non-rigid airships. Among the most famous was the California Arrow, powered by a small Curtiss engine and piloted by Roy Knabenshue at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. In 1905, the Baldwin Airship Company was incorporated, and Captain Baldwin soon became a major name in the early American aviation circles. In 1907, the Baldwin company was commissioned by the U.S. Army Signal Corps to build a 600 cu m (20,000 cu ft) capacity airship. The 29 m (96 ft) long non-rigid was powered by a 20-horsepower Curtiss engine, traveled at a speed of 20 mph, and had a total lifting capability of 617 kg (1,360 lb). It was tested successfully for the Army in August 1908 and was designated the SC-1."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1909, Baldwin shifted his focus to heavier-than-air flight. During late 1909 and early 1910, Curtiss built an airplane of his design for him. It was a tractor biplane with a biplane tail similar to the well-known Farman design, and it had a large vertical surface mounted above the top wing for lateral steering. The original 25-horsepower, four-cylinder Curtiss engine was quickly replaced by a Curtiss V-8. By the summer of 1910, Baldwin was testing a second airplane at Mineola, Long Island.

The origin of the name appears to stem from Baldwin's painting his aircraft bright crimson overall. There is also an unsubstantiated story that following an accident, Baldwin emerged from the wreckage of his airplane angrily voicing some choice phrases in the presence of a young girl who had witnessed the incident.

It differs from other Red Devils in a number of ways, most significantly in that is has no forward elevator. Also, it has single ailerons mounted between the wings, rather than the trailing edge ailerons on both wings that were typical of other Red Devils. One photograph exists of a Red Devil with no forward elevator and trailing edge ailerons, as well as a picture of yet another with a forward elevator and single interplane ailerons, thus demonstrating that the unusual features of the NASM airplane did appear on other confirmed Red Devils. Unfortunately, no picture of the NASM Red Devil exists showing the airplane before the First World War, when it was presumably built and flown. Another apparent difference of the NASM airplane is the engine type. It came to the museum with a 50-horsepower Maximotor B-4 installed.

The American army began to develop programs to design and build assault gliders, and train crews to fly them. But American industry was under tremendous pressure to expand production, and create and field new weapons. The national military leadership was forced to assign priorities and they ranked gliders well behind fighters and bombers. Henry H. \"Hap\" Arnold, commanding general of the Army Air Forces (AAF), declared that glider contracts could be awarded only to civilian manufacturing firms not already committed to military aircraft production. The AAF contacted eleven companies and invited them to submit glider designs for 2-, 8-, and 15-man gliders in March 1941, but only four returned bids: Bowlus Sailplanes, Inc, St. Louis Aircraft Corporation, Waco Aircraft Company, and the Frankfort Sailplane Company."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Before submitting his bid, Stan Corcoran had produced gliders for the civilian market at his Frankfort Sailplane Company factory. He was well known among competition glider pilots, and in the late 1930s, he had started small-scale construction of his Cinema I single-place glider in Frankfort, Michigan. Civilian interest in gliding was growing at a steady pace and Corcoran's company soon relocated to larger facilities in Joilet, Illinois. When the request for military gliders came out, Corcoran responded with a two-place training glider design, essentially a Cinema I with provision for another pilot. Corcoran also attempted to win contracts for production of the 8- and 15-man cargo gliders. However, during tests, Corcoran's prototype, 8-seat cargo glider, the XCG-1, suffered structural failure at only 63% of its design load strength, and Corcoran was advised to stick to designing light training gliders."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On May 26, 1941, the Frankfort Sailplane Company received a $5,784 contract from the AAF for three prototypes of a two-place glider designated XTG-1. This was the first contract issued for a U. S. training glider. The new design, soon to be called the Cinema II or Corcoran Model B, consisted of an additional tandem seat in a stretched cockpit. Other changes included a fixed horizontal stabilizer and elevator in place of the all-moving stabilator on the Cinema I. Stall speed was only 59 km/h (36 mph) and the never- exceed speed was calculated at 130 km/h (80 mph)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Corcoran welded together pieces of steel tubing to form the TG-1A fuselage and wings and covered them with cotton fabric. He constructed the horizontal and vertical stabilizers from wood, and he installed plywood spoilers on the upper wing surface. The pilot could increase the glider's rate-of-descent by approximately .8 m/s, or 150 fpm, using the spoilers. The tandem cockpit consisted of two canvas seats equipped with dual flight controls and instrumentation, and covered by a multi-pane, plexiglass canopy. A hinged section of the canopy gave access to the front seat, a small, quick-release door on the right side of the fuselage allowed access to the rear seat. Instrumentation consisted of an airspeed indicator, altimeter, rate-of-climb indicator, turn and bank indicator, and compass, duplicated for both front and rear seats. A single radio was included in the front-seat position."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Landing gear consisted of a single wheel and tire (fitted with a brake) installed on the bottom of the fuselage, behind the leading edge of the wing, and a wooden skid with rubber shock absorbers placed in front of the wheel. A small tailskid protected the fragile rudder and vertical stabilizer during ground handling."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In May 1942, the Frankfort Sailplane Company received a contract to build 40 TG-1As. Production began immediately and the order was completed by November 1942. Each glider cost $2,775 to build but Corcoran's factory lacked the resources to quickly produce large numbers of gliders. The Schweizer Aircraft Corporation easily built many more TG-2 gliders, a design similar to the TG-1A. By war's end, nearly 1,100 dedicated military training gliders were completed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The expense and casualties involved in the U. S. combat glider program during World War II raise questions about its ultimate value. Operations in Europe achieved mixed results and heavy casualties. However, in Burma, combat gliders proved very useful in placing troops and equipment behind Japanese lines. After the war, the glider force was abandoned and eventually replaced by the more versatile and cost-effective helicopter. All training gliders, such as the TG-1A, were declared surplus and offered for sale to the public. Sport gliding resurged when these cheap gliders flooded the market but this also forced most glider manufacturers, including Corcoran, into serious financial difficulty."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"More than thirty years after combat glider pilots trained in it, Stan Corcoran donated a TG-1A to Lewis University in Illinois. An aircraft structures class at the University fully restored the aircraft and test flew it as a class project. Lewis University donated it to the Smithsonian Institution in 1983. The glider is painted in the blue and yellow colors specified for training aircraft during World War II."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400034696-0","title":"Navigational Satellite, Transit 5-A","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv991b18449-f582-460c-b7d6-4783b637cd44","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"Beginning in the 1960s, the United States Navy began developing a communications and navigation satellite program to meet the needs of ships at sea and submarines.

Hurricanes proved vital to win the Battle of Britain during the summer of 1940, when the Nazi Blitzkrieg seemed unstoppable. These airplanes also performed other roles flying on nearly every front until the end of the war. The Hurricane was the first British monoplane fighter aircraft, and the first British fighter to exceed 483 kph (300 mph) in level flight. That it was designed and built at all was a major undertaking that literally flew in the face of conventional aeronautical wisdom in the mid-1930s. At that time, the biplane was omnipresent and monoplanes were considered unstable and too radical to be successful fighter aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1925, Camm was appointed Chief Designer of the H. G. Hawker Engineering Company, the forerunner of Hawker Aircraft Ltd. During that same year, Camm designed a monoplane fighter and although it was not built, he realized that biplane fighters could not be designed to go faster than monoplanes. Two wings simply generated more drag than a single wing. It was time for a radical advance in fighter technology. In 1933, under Camm's direction, the Hawker design team began work on a new monoplane fighter and informal design proposals were made to the Air Ministry in August 1935. Camm and his team proposed a single-wing adaptation of the highly successful Hawker Fury biplane. They selected a liquid-cooled, 660 horsepower Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine to power the new aircraft. It was called the Fury Monoplane. Soon a new powerplant, forerunner of the legendary Rolls-Royce Merlin, was proposed for this airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Camm revised the design, based on this new engine, and introduced a wide track, hand-operated, retractable landing gear, a retracting tail wheel, and an enclosed cockpit. These features reduced drag even further and made the aircraft faster. More modifications and refinements followed and on September 4, 1934, Camm submitted a new, revised design known as the Interceptor Monoplane. A mock-up was begun later that year. Official approval for a prototype was given in February 1935 and the military serial number K5083 was assigned to this revolutionary airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Interceptor Monoplane was a blend of the old and new. It was a monoplane with retractable landing gear but the internal airframe structure reverted to the formula Hawker had proven on all his biplanes: tubular metal cross braced sections covered with fabric. While the prototype was under construction, another new specification was issued, causing a design change from a four-machine gun armament system to a scheme that used eight, license-built, American .303 caliber, Browning weapons. A Rolls Royce Merlin, twelve-cylinder, 990 horsepower engine driving a two-blade, fixed-pitch wooden propeller, supplied power. Despite early engine difficulties, the new aircraft proved to have excellent potential. It flew for the first time on November 6, 1935."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Flight trials began immediately but engine troubles continued to plague the aircraft and the Merlin engine was continuously upgraded to increase performance and reliability. Camm had started out with the Merlin C series engine, then tried the F series, known as the Merlin I, and then the Merlin II. The Merlin III, developing 1,030 horsepower, became the most satisfactory engine variant and it powered most of the early production aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As prototype evaluation continued, Hawker received an unprecedented contract order for 600 aircraft on June 3, 1936. This was one of the largest production orders ever placed for a single military aircraft design during peacetime. On the 27th, the name Hurricane was officially adopted. Hawker was expecting production orders so the company had already began to tool their production lines to build the airplane. They made 40 within three months and a short time later, the Royal Air Force (RAF) accepted their first Hurricane. In December 1937, ten weeks after the first flight of a production Hurricane I on October 12, 1937, the first RAF squadron to convert to the new fighter, No. 111 at Northolt, traded in their Gloster Gauntlets biplanes for the new monoplanes. Hawker never paused in flight-testing improvements to the fighter and in 1939, the company began using the variable-pitch, three-bladed propeller. This technology significantly increased the Hurricane's climb performance and service ceiling."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"This relentless pace of production, the introduction to service, and continued flight-testing was driven initially by the threat of war posed by Nazi Germany. When Hitler invaded Poland in 1939, the Hurricane joined the fight. Hurricane pilots drew first blood for the RAF during air battles fought over France. Flying a Hurricane, Pilot Officer P. W. O. Mould of No. 1 Squadron, RAF, destroyed a Dornier Do17 (German twin-engine bomber) on October 30, 1939. Soon several Hurricane squadrons were heavily engaged with German aircraft but the Luftwaffe (German air force) outnumbered the smaller force of British fighters and inflicted heavy casualties."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Hurricane's most important role in World War II came a few months later during the Battle of Britain, fought between July and October 1940. On the eve of this great battle for England's survival as a free country, the British could muster only 26 Hurricane I squadrons. In addition to Hurricanes, there were 19 Supermarine Spitfire squadrons and 10 other fighter squadrons equipped with Defiants and Blenheims. Once the battle began, these latter two aircraft quickly proved utterly inferior to the Messerschmitt Bf 109. All together, RAF Fighter Command had about 720 serviceable Hurricanes, Spitfires, and other combat airplanes. Against them stood a force of about 2,000 Luftwaffe aircraft, flush with sweeping victories over every air force in Europe that had opposed them."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"For Hitler's Luftwaffe, the primary goal of the great contest about to unfold was to engage and destroy all RAF fighter aircraft in the air or on the ground. Once this was accomplished, Hitler could launch Operation Sealion, the amphibious invasion of Great Britain, unopposed by the RAF. The Luftwaffe would then revert to its earlier role as the air component of Blitzkrieg, or Lightning War. German fighters, in conjunction with level bombers such as the Heinkel 111, and the Junkers Ju 87 dive bomber, would work in direct support of the German Army's tank and infantry forces by attacking British troops, tanks, and fortifications."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The battle for air superiority over England saw RAF Fighter Command devise a strategy for singling out the German bombers. They assigned Hurricane squadrons to concentrate on the bombers while the faster Spitfires engaged the escorting fighters. This tactic was determined by the differences in performance between the Spitfire and the Hurricane. The primary German fighter airplane, the Messerschmitt Bf109, outclassed the Hawker fighter in speed and armament; the difference was small enough that many times the outcome depended upon individual pilot skills. The Hurricane did enjoy several advantages over the Bf 109. It could out-turn the German fighter at all operational altitudes, it could sustain more damage and return to base, and when battle damage was so severe that a crash-landing became unavoidable, the Hurricane usually fell on friendly territory. The Hurricane's sturdy tubular construction allowed many machines to survive combat and return quickly to the fight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Battle of Britain ended in early November when Göring ordered the Luftwaffe to switch to bombing cities, ports, and factories at night. The sea borne invasion was called off and Hitler turned his attention east to plan the invasion of Russia. It had been a near thing for Britain. The RAF nearly ran out of pilots and serviceable aircraft. Mechanics patched together every Hurricane and Spitfire that could stagger back into the air but losses were terrific. Between July 10 and October 31, the Germans lost 1,733 aircraft to the RAF. The Royal Air Force lost 915 airplanes and 415 pilots. Hurricane production figures reveal the airplane's critical importance to the RAF. Every week of the battle, Hurricane losses exceeded that of any other fighter type, yet the Air Ministry consistently ordered more Hurricanes built than any other type of fighters (Spitfires, Blenheims, and Defiants)."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As the Battle of Britain ended, Hawker continued to modify and improve the Hurricane. At the same time, several Hurricane squadrons learned night fighter tactics and many Hurricanes were modified to fly and fight in darkness and bad weather. Others were fitted with tropical filters and sent overseas to the Mediterranean. Hawker also sold Hurricanes to Yugoslavia, Belgium, Iran, Rumania, Turkey, and Poland. Early in 1941, the Royal Yugoslavian Air Force replaced the Merlin engine with a Daimler Benz DB601A. After flight trials, Yugoslavian test pilot claimed the German engine was superior to the Merlin. Hurricanes also fought in Malta and the western desert of North Africa. The Hurricane even went to sea aboard CAM (Catapult Aircraft Merchantmen) ships. These hastily modified sea-borne interceptors were nicknamed 'Hurricats.'"},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Hawker design staff wanted to increase engine power without interrupting production, so they selected a new, more powerful version of the Merlin. The new Merlin XX engine was only slightly larger than earlier versions, yet it generated 1,280 horsepower and a maximum speed in the Hurricane of 550 kph (342 mph). This new version was called the Hurricane II and a prototype first flew on June 11, 1940. Armament was increased from eight guns (Mark IIA) to twelve guns (Mark IIB). The biggest weapons modification came with the Mark IIC Hurricane. A specification dating back to 1935 had called for a fighter armed with four 20mm cannons. After initial test results proved successful, Hawker began building the Mark IIC in 1941 equipped with a very potent battery of four 20 mm Oerlikon cannons, and more than 4,700 examples of this Hurricane were built."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Several other variants of the Hurricane appeared including the Mark IID with two 40mm cannons mounted under the wings. Most of the Mark IID's were shipped to the Middle East, North Africa and Burma, and one squadron flew them in northern Europe. The Mark IV Hurricane showed little difference from the Mark II series, but it had improved armor and universal wing mounts for various ground attack roles. Several other versions of the Hurricane were created including Sea Hurricanes designed for convoy escort and equipped with arresting hooks. From 1936 until production ended in September 1944, Hawker, Gloster, Canadian Car and Foundry, and Fairey built 14,233 Hurricanes. One of the last Hurricanes built was purchased by the Hawker Company and named \"The Last of the Many.\" It is maintained in flying condition to this day."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The National Air and Space Museum owns a Hawker Hurricane Mk.

It was part of the last RAF Hurricane order for about 1,300 aircraft. On March 14, 1944, the RAF moved LF686 to No. 5 Maintenance Unit at RAF Kemble airfield for installation of operational equipment. The fighter was delivered to No. 41 Operational Training Unit at RAF Hawarden airfield in Cheshire on April 15, 1944. It served in this OTU until the RAF reclassified the aircraft a maintenance training airframe, number 5270M, on June 27, 1945, and transferred it to RAF Maintenance Command at Chilbolton, Hampshire, where it was used to train mechanics. At some point the original engine was probably removed. In July 1948, the RAF issued the Hurricane to No. 7 School for Recruit Training, RAF Bridgenorth. Another Merlin XX was installed and the fighter was placed outdoors, opposite the guardroom. Sometime later, the entire airplane was painted silver. In 1963, Bridgenorth closed its doors and LF686 moved to RAF Colherne for overhaul and storage."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the late 1960s, the Smithsonian arranged to trade a stock Hawker Typhoon to the Royal Air Force Museum at Hendon in exchange for Hawker Hurricane LF686.

On 30 August 1961, NASA launched the first Ranger, but the launch vehicle placed it in the wrong orbit. Two more attempts in 1961 failed, as did two more attempts in 1962. NASA then reorganized the Ranger project and did not try to launch again until 1964. By this time its engineers had eliminated all the scientific instruments except a television camera. Ranger's sole remaining objective was to go out in a blaze of glory as it crashed into the Moon while taking high-resolution pictures. Finally, on 31 July 1964, the seventh Ranger worked and transmitted 4,316 beautiful, high-resolution pictures of the lunar Sea of Clouds.

As these impressive demonstrations were taking place, the Luftwaffe was delivering twenty-four '109 fighters to Spain for the Condor Legion.

Nicknamed 'Gustav' and powered by a DB 605 engine, the 'G' carried a variety of machine guns, bombs, and cannons and occasionally, two 20mm MG 151/20 weapons slung beneath the wings. The latter combination was ideal for bomber interception but severely reduced air-to-air combat effectiveness."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"For many years, the history of the NASM Bf 109G-6 was mysterious.

Darbois was a native of German-annexed Lorraine who claimed he was forced to fly in the Luftwaffe. He took off in the NASM BF 109G-6 on his first combat mission and proceeded directly to the airfield at Caserta, Italy. He landed and walked into the custody of the U. S.

Operating under a very strict schedule, the Skunk Works produced the new U-2 just eight months later. Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier flew the single-seat U-2 on its maiden flight on August 6, 1955. With its narrow chord and sailplane-like wing, the lightly loaded U-2 refused to land until LeVier's fifth attempt brought it back to Earth. The U-2 was subjected to an accelerated test program which revealed a number of problems that were quickly overcome, particularly that of engine flameouts at high altitude. This was solved by the development of new low-volatility fuel for the single Pratt and Whitney J57 turbojet."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"CIA pilot training began in the spring of 1956 and by the summer the first models of the jet, the U-2A, became operational. On July 4, 1956, a U-2A completed the first overflight of the Soviet Union. Sophisticated electronic and camera equipment was housed in the nose and in a large fuselage bay. Large fuel tanks enabled the aircraft to fly for six hours over almost 4,600 kilometers (3,000 miles) at altitudes in excess of 60,000 feet. Operational U-2As flew routinely from bases in Pakistan and Turkey to Norway, overflying vast stretches of the Soviet Union. These flights gathered much important data and particularly revealed that the so-called 'missile gap\" in the Soviet's favor was a myth, thus altering the delicate strategic balance. For four years the CIA operated these flights with U-2As and improved U-2Bs until May 1,1960, when Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a Soviet SA-2 missile over Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), thus sparking an embarrassing diplomatic incident for the United States and halting these flights."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Flights over the People's Republic of China, however, continued unabated from bases in Taiwan, as did flights over Cuba from U.S. bases. On August 29, 1962, a U-2 confirmed the presence of Soviet intermediate-range ballistic missiles on that island nation, which led to the Cuban Missile Crisis. U-2s were also in demand to gather information over Vietnam after July 1964, operating continually until the fall of Saigon in 1975. Since then, U-2s have observed the developing situations in the Middle East and other political hot spots."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The U-2's remarkable high-altitude abilities have also made it a valuable tool for scientific research. NASA has operated two of these aircraft in its High Altitude Missions Branch, where the U-2 has proved to be useful in stratospheric sampling, particularly in gathering volcanic dust after the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens, and has been involved in assessments of natural disasters and water and land use."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Numerous versions of the U-2 have been produced, each one providing important improvements in performance and mission capability, including two-seat models and models that can be operated from aircraft carriers.

The NASM Caudron is among the oldest surviving bomber aircraft in the world, and one of the very few remaining multi-engine aircraft from this period."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Gaston and René Caudron were among the earliest aircraft manufacturers in France. After building and testing a few original designs in 1909 and early in 1910, the brothers established a flight training school at Crotoy and an aircraft factory at Rue in 1910. The first factory-produced Caudron was the type A4, a 35-horsepower Anzani-powered tractor biplane in which the pilot sat completely exposed behind the rear spar of the lower wing. The next major Caudron design, the type B, was the first to feature the abbreviated fuselage/pilot nacelle, characteristic of many later Caudron aircraft. It was powered by a 70-horsepower Gnôme or 60-horsepower Anzani engine mounted in the front of the nacelle with the pilot immediately behind. Although a tractor, the tail unit of the type B was supported by booms extending from the trailing edge of the wings, an arrangement more commonly featured on pusher aircraft. Lateral control was accomplished with wing warping. The type B established the basic configuration of Caudron designs through the G.4 model."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The first of the well-known Caudron G series aircraft appeared in 1912. Initially designed as a trainer, the type G was developed into the G.2 by the outbreak of the First World War, and saw limited military service in 1914 as single and two-seat versions. By that time the Caudron factory had been relocated to Lyon, where an improved version, designated the G.3, was being produced in significant numbers. Soon a second factory was opened at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, to meet military demand for the airplane. The G.3 was primarily a two-seat aircraft, but a few were converted to single-seat versions. They were powered variously by 80-horsepower Le Rhône or Gnôme rotary engines or a 90-horsepower Anzani radial. A total of 2,450 G.3s were built, including a small number built under license in Britain and Italy."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Caudron G.4 was a larger, twin-engined version of the G.3, powered by two 80-horsepower Le Rhônes or 100-horsepower Anzanis. The Anzani-powered Caudron G.4s served mostly as training aircraft. Some of the Anzani-powered G.4s, but not all, had their engines set up to turn in opposite directions to balance the torque of the whirling propellers. All the Le Rhône-powered Caudrons had both engines rotating in the same direction, clockwise from the pilot's orientation. Also, the two vertical tail surfaces of the G.3 were increased to four on the G.4. The twin-engined configuration increased the range of the Caudron and provided a location for a forward-firing machine gun, typically a Hotchkiss or Lewis, although other types were also used. To protect against attacks from behind, some G.4s were fitted with an additional gun mounted on the top of the upper wing and pointed rearward, but this proved to be ineffective and it was frequently removed from operational aircraft. A number of G.4s had a second gun mounted immediately in front of the pilot on the deck of the nacelle (such as on the NASM Caudron). But more often the pilot and observer simply carried hand-held weapons to respond to attacks from the rear. Some G.4s carried a camera for high-altitude reconnaissance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The prototype G.4 first flew in March 1915, and 1,358 were built in three major versions: the Caudron G.4A2 for reconnaissance, the G.4B2 for bombing, and the G.4E2 for training. The A2 had a wireless set for artillery spotting missions; the B2 could carry up to 100 kg (220 lb) of bombs; and the E2 had dual controls for instruction. A special armored version of the G.4, designated the G.4IB, was deployed to the top French units, the \"B\" representing Blindage, the French word for armor. In addition to reconnaissance, bombing, and training, the Caudron G.4 also sometimes served as a long-range escort to other bomber aircraft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By 1916, the G.4 was replacing the G.3 in most Caudron squadrons. Extensively used as a bomber during the first half of 1916, its deployment in that role was severely reduced by the fall of that year. The Caudron's relative slow speed and inability to defend itself from the rear made it increasingly vulnerable to fighter attack as German air defense improved. But Caudrons continued to be widely used as reconnaissance aircraft well into 1917. By early 1918 virtually all Caudron aircraft still in use were relegated to training duties. In addition to the French, Caudrons were used extensively by British and Italian units, and a few were used by the Russians and the Belgians. Ten Caudron G.4s were sold to the United States in November 1917 and transferred to the U.S. Air Service's 2nd Air Instruction Center at Tours. Used exclusively as trainers, none of these Caudrons saw operational service with American units."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Caudron G.4 was in many respects a pre-war design, with its wing-warping lateral control, light structure, and limited visibility.

As an individual museum specimen, the NASM Caudron G.4 also has great significance. It is among the oldest surviving bomber aircraft in the world. Further, it is the only very early multi-engine airplane in the NASM collection, and one of the very few multi-engine aircraft from this period anywhere."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Caudron G.4 in the NASM collection, serial # C4263, was built by the Eugene firm and left the factory on December 12, 1916. The marking \"12_16\" appears on the leading edge of each individual wing section and some other major components of the aircraft, confirming the manufacturing date acquired from archival sources. Its acceptance flight was made at Issy-les-Moulineaux on December 27, 1916. The pilot's name was Gerviès and it was reported that the airplane climbed to 1000 m (3,281 ft) in 7 minutes. The airplane had full radio and photographic equipment, characterized by the A2 reconnaissance variant. Caudron G.4 serial # C4263 saw no operational activity with the French Air Service. It was apparently sent to the Reserve Générale of the Aviation Militaire and remained there until it was purchased by the United States government in early 1917 through the American Ambassador, Mr. Sharp. The Caudron was acquired, along with a Voisin Type 8 (also in the NASM collection) and a Farman aircraft, for technical evaluation by the United States. However, by the time the aircraft were transported to the U.S. and prepared for flight demonstrations, they were already outmoded. This airplane was not among the ten purchased late in 1917 and deployed as trainers. Photographic evidence demonstrates that the NASM Caudron had arrived in the U.S. and was at Langley Field, Hampton, Virginia, at least by July 26, 1917, four months before the contract for the ten training aircraft was executed."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In a 1966 article in the journal Cross & Cockade on the NASM Caudron, the author, Brian Flanagan, states that at some point before the end of the war, \"the Caudron and the Voisin were exhibited in a park in Washington, D.C., as part of a war drive display.\" But he cites no source for this fact."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"On July 12, 1918, Lt. Col. L.S. Horner, of the War Department's Bureau of Aircraft Production, wrote to Smithsonian Institution Secretary, Charles Walcott, regarding \"obsolete airplanes for exhibition purposes,\" offering the Caudron, the Voisin, and the Farman aircraft to the Institution. The offer was accepted and the three airplanes were delivered to the museum on September 16 and 17, 1918. The Farman was very incomplete and was deemed unacceptable for exhibition. It was returned to the War Department in June 1921. Because of an oversight when packing the Farman for shipment, its wings remained at the Smithsonian until September 1925, when they were either returned to the War Department or destroyed. The record is unclear."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Caudron was delivered to the Smithsonian without engines, propellers, or armament. It was soon assembled and suspended in the Arts and Industries building, lacking these components. In 1929, Paul Garber, of the Smithsonian curatorial staff, acquired engines and propellers from the War Department, and had them installed on the Caudron. Unfortunately, Garber was unable to obtain the proper 80-horsepower Le Rhône rotary engines. Only 110-horsepower Le Rhônes were available, and Garber considered these to be at least representative of the correct powerplants. Similarly, the propellers acquired and installed on the airplane were only representative of the period and not the precise type that were actually used on the Caudron. Internal parts of the 110-horsepower Le Rhônes, such as pistons, connecting rods, etc., were removed from the engines to lighten them and put in storage. Smithsonian officials took this action as a safety measure because the airplane was suspended over a public area. The Caudron was displayed in this manner until the late 1960s or early 1970s, when it was removed from the Arts and Industries building and placed in storage at the Garber Facility. It received preservation treatment in 2000. Also at that time, the incorrect 110-horsepower Le Rhône rotary engines were replaced with the proper 80-horsepower Le Rhônes, and correct propellers were fabricated."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"One interesting marking on the tail of the NASM Caudron is the term \"Blindage 16K\" on the rudders. Blindage is the French word for armored, indicating that the museum's airplane could be one of the special G.4IB armored Caudrons. The armor consisted of a heavy metal plate inserted behind the seat of the rear cockpit, protruding upward so as to cover the back and head of the pilot. The armor plate is missing on the NASM Caudron. However, there is a gap, or slot, in the structure immediately behind the seat where such a plate would fit. Photographs of other Caudrons with the armor plate inserted show it in the same location as the slot behind the rear seat on the NASM Caudron. This, along with the marking \"Blindage 16 K,\" strongly indicate that the NASM airplane was an armored version of the Caudron G.4."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023581-0","title":"Indicator, Cylinder Head Temperature, Japanese Navy, Mark-1,","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9ece64418-e321-495b-aa0e-f845078d5b46","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"81mm diameter; black face; 0 to 350 c.; for judy; World War II; Navy."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023381-0","title":"Transmitter, Dual Oil Pressure,B-9, B-9A","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9425a4790-f72c-4769-8b46-1cafa903af86","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"2-1/2in. diameter; World War II; electric; 26v; range 0-200psi."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400041447-0","title":"Model, Recognition, Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen (Zero), \"Zeke\"","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv948e0ec43-1dd6-40ba-ad28-56f4b7531f29","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Wood recognition model of a Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen (Zero), codename \"Zeke\", fighter aircraft in overall flat black. 1/72 scale."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400022869-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Pressure","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e1e0c9de-d8eb-4fab-afca-df23497a86d6","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"Circa 1943; range 0-25psi; 5.5cm d; 2-1/4in. dial."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400023565-0","title":"Indicator, Fuel Quantity, Japanese Army","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv92a2aacfa-87d8-4c77-b5a1-11dfcda77ea4","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"83mm diameter; black face; 0 to 190; for tojo; red warning light; World War II"}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400025064-0","title":"North American X-15","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9d2c52e77-2f46-4a14-b2d0-6317b55f63f5","description":[{"label":"Physical Description","content":"North American X-15, rocket powered experimental aircraft; black titanium skin with wedge shaped horizontal stablizer; yellow stripe NASA inisignia on tail with stars and red bars United States national insignia on wings; white letter text \"U.S. AIR FORCE\" on the sides of the fuselage."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The North American X-15 rocket-powered research aircraft bridged the gap between manned flight within the atmosphere and manned flight beyond the atmosphere into space.

Indeed, the X-15 design was so much like that of a space vehicle that during the formative days of Project Mercury, America’s first attempt to put a man in orbit, North American and National Air and Space Administration (NASA) engineers gave serious consideration to utilizing a growth version of the X-15 for the manned orbiting mission. This plan was dropped in favor of using a blunt-body reentry vehicle. Because of the potential dangers to the pilot should the X-15’s pressurized cockpit lose its atmosphere while the aircraft operated in a near-space environment, X-15 pilots wore specially developed full-pressure protection ‘spacesuits’ while flying the experimental plane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Three X-15 research aircraft were built and flown, completing a total of 199 research flights.

The X-15A-2 was the fastest X-15 flown, and it is now on exhibit at the Air Force Museum, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. The X-15 #3 (56-6672) featured an advanced cockpit display panel and a special adaptive control system.

Various proposals were set forth for modifying the aircraft to accomplish new and even more radical tasks. At one point, NASA scientists planned to test a hydrogen-fueled supersonic combustion ramjet engine mounted on the X-15s lower vertical fin. A mock-up of this proposed installation was flight-tested on the X-15A-2.

By the time of its first airborne test, flight research was too complex to rely on simple air-to-ground communications near a test field. The Air Force and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics developed a special 485-mile-long test corridor stretching from Wendover Air Force Base. Utah. to Edwards Air Force Base. California. It was planned that the X15 would be air-launched from a Boeing B-52 near Wendover. then fly down this corridor, the High Range. to Edwards. monitored by tracking stations at Ely and Beatty.

The X-15 would complete its research mission and then. followed by special Lockheed F-104 chase aircraft. would land on the hard clay of Rogers (formerly Muroc) Dry Lake. Because the X-15 featured a cruciform tail surface arrangement. it was necessary for the designers to make the lower half of the ventral fin jettisonable prior to landing so that the conventional two-wheel, nose-landing gear and two tail-mounted landing skids could support the aircraft."},{"label":"Alternate Name","content":"North American X-15"},{"label":"Key Accomplishment(s)","content":"World's Fastest Piloted Aircraft"},{"label":"Impact or Innovation","content":"The X-15 gathered critical flight data that made human spaceflight and future hypersonic aircraft possible."},{"label":"Brief Description","content":"First flown in 1959, the North American X-15 bridged the gap between human flight in the atmosphere and spaceflight.

This airplane, known as the Wright Flyer, sometimes referred to as the Kitty Hawk Flyer, was the product of a sophisticated four-year program of research and development conducted by Wilbur and Orville Wright beginning in 1899. During the Wrights' design and construction of their experimental aircraft they also pioneered many of the basic tenets and techniques of modern aeronautical engineering, such as the use of a wind tunnel and flight testing as design tools. Their seminal accomplishment encompassed not only the breakthrough first flight of an airplane, but also the equally important achievement of establishing the foundation of aeronautical engineering."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Wright brothers had a passing interest in flight as youngsters. In 1878 their father gave them a toy flying helicopter model powered by strands of twisted rubber. They played and experimented with it extensively and even built several larger copies of the device. They also had some experience with kites. But not until 1896, prompted by the widely publicized fatal crash of famed glider pioneer Otto Lilienthal, did the Wrights begin serious study of flight. After absorbing what materials related to the subject the brothers had available locally, Wilbur wrote to the Smithsonian Institution on May 30, 1899, requesting any publications on aeronautics that it could offer."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Shortly after their receipt of the Smithsonian materials, the Wrights built their first aeronautical craft, a five-foot-wingspan biplane kite, in the summer of 1899. The Wrights chose to follow Lilienthal's lead of using gliders as a stepping stone towards a practical powered airplane. The 1899 kite was built as a preliminary test device to establish the viability of the control system that they planned to use in their first full-size glider. This means of control would be a central feature of the later successful powered airplane."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Rather than controlling the craft by altering the center of gravity by shifting the pilot's body weight as Lilienthal had done, the Wrights intended to balance their glider aerodynamically. They reasoned that if a wing generates lift when presented to an oncoming flow of air, producing differing amounts of lift on either end of the wing would cause one side to rise more than the other, which in turn would bank the entire aircraft. A mechanical means of inducing this differential lift would provide the pilot with effective lateral control of the airplane. The Wrights accomplished this by twisting, or warping, the tips of the wings in opposite directions via a series of lines attached to the outer edges of the wings that were manipulated by the pilot. The idea advanced aeronautical experimentation significantly because it provided an effective method of controlling an airplane in three-dimensional space and, because it was aerodynamically based, it did not limit the size of the aircraft as shifting body weight obviously did. The satisfactory performance of the 1899 kite demonstrated the practicality of the wing warping control system."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Encouraged by the success of their small wing warping kite, the brothers built and flew two full-size piloted gliders in 1900 and 1901. Beyond the issue of control, the Wrights had to grapple with developing an efficient airfoil shape and solving fundamental problems of structural design. Like the kite, these gliders were biplanes. For control of climb and descent, the gliders had forward-mounted horizontal stabilizers. Neither craft had a tail. The Wrights' home of Dayton, Ohio, did not offer suitable conditions for flying the gliders. An inquiry with the U.S. Weather Bureau identified Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with its sandy, wide-open spaces and strong, steady winds as an optimal test site. In September 1900, the Wrights made their first trip to the little fishing hamlet that they would make world famous."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although the control system worked well and the structural design of the craft was sound, the lift of the gliders was substantially less than the Wrights' earlier calculations had predicted. They began to question seriously the aerodynamic data that they had used. Now at a critical juncture, Wilbur and Orville decided to conduct an extensive series of tests of wing shapes. They built a small wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to gather a body of accurate aerodynamic data with which to design their next glider. The heart of the Wright wind tunnel was the ingeniously designed pair of test instruments that were mounted inside. These measured coefficients of lift and drag on small model wing shapes, the terms in the equations for calculating lift and drag about which the brothers were in doubt."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Wrights' third glider, built in 1902 based on the wind tunnel experiments, was a dramatic success. The lift problems were solved, and with a few refinements to the control system (the key one being a movable vertical tail), they were able to make numerous extended controlled glides. They made between seven hundred and one thousand flights in 1902. The single best one was 191.5 m (622.5 ft) in twenty-six seconds. The brothers were now convinced that they stood at the threshold of realizing mechanical flight."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the spring and summer of 1903 they built their first powered airplane. Essentially a larger and sturdier version of the 1902 glider, the only fundamentally new component of the 1903 aircraft was the propulsion system. With the assistance of their bicycle shop mechanic, Charles Taylor, the Wrights built a small, twelve-horsepower gasoline engine. While the engine was a significant enough achievement, the genuinely innovative feature of the propulsion system was the propellers. The brothers conceived the propellers as rotary wings, producing a horizontal thrust force aerodynamically. By turning an airfoil section on its side and spinning it to create an air flow over the surface, the Wrights reasoned that a horizontal \"lift\" force would be generated that would propel the airplane forward. The concept was one of the most original and creative aspects of the Wrights' aeronautical work. The 1903 airplane was fitted with two propellers mounted behind the wings and connected to the engine, centrally located on the bottom wing, via a chain-and-sprocket transmission system."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By the fall of 1903, the powered airplane was ready for trial. A number of problems with the engine transmission system delayed the first flight attempt until mid-December. After winning the toss of a coin to determine which brother would make the first try, Wilbur took the pilot's position and made an unsuccessful attempt on December 14th, damaging the Flyer slightly. Repairs were completed for a second attempt on December 17. It was now Orville's turn. At 10:35 a.m. the Flyer lifted off the beach at Kitty Hawk for a 12-second flight, traveling 36 m (120 ft). Three more flights were made that morning, the brothers alternating as pilot. The second and third were in the range of two hundred feet. With Wilbur at the controls, the fourth and last flight covered 255.6 m (852 ft) in 59 seconds. With this final long, sustained effort, there was no question the Wrights had flown."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As the brothers and the others present discussed the long flight, a gust of wind overturned the Wright Flyer and sent it tumbling across the sand. The aircraft was severely damaged and never flown again. But the Wrights had achieved what they had set out to do. They had successfully demonstrated their design for a heavier-than-air flying machine. They built refined versions of the Flyer in 1904 and 1905, bringing the design to practicality. On October 5, 1905, with the brothers' third powered airplane, Wilbur made a spectacular 39-minute flight that covered 39.2 km (24.5 miles) over a closed course."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After the first powered Flyer of 1903 took its destructive tumble at Kitty Hawk, the Wrights crated it and shipped it back to Dayton where it remained in storage in a shed behind their bicycle shop, untouched for more than a decade. In March 1913, Dayton was hit by a serious flood, during which the boxes containing the Flyer were submerged in water and mud for eleven days. The airplane was uncrated, for the first time since Kitty Hawk, in the summer of 1916, when Orville repaired and reassembled the airplane for brief exhibition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Several other brief displays followed. It was exhibited at the New York Aero Show in 1917, at a Society of Automotive Engineers meeting in Dayton in 1918, at the New York Aero Show in 1919, and at the National Air Races in Dayton in 1924. On each of these occasions the Wright Flyer was prepared and assembled for exhibition by a Wright Company mechanic named Jim Jacobs, working under the supervision of Orville."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1928 the airplane was placed on loan to the Science Museum in London. Before shipping it to Europe, Orville and Jim Jacobs refurbished the Flyer extensively. The fabric covering was replaced completely with new material, although it was of the same type as the original \"Pride of the West\" muslin. The remaining 1903 fabric that was on the airplane when it flew was saved and portions of it still exist in various places. During World War II, the airplane was kept in an underground storage facility near the village of Corsham, approximately 160 km (100 miles) from London, where various British national treasures were secured. The Flyer was not stored in the London subway as has been often asserted. The airplane was returned to the United States in 1948 and formally donated to the Smithsonian Institution in an elaborate ceremony on December 17, the 45th anniversary of the flights, and it has been on public display there ever since."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Flyer received some minor repairs and cleaning in 1976 just before being moved into the Smithsonian's then new National Air and Space Museum building. In 1985, the airplane was given its first major treatment since preparing it for loan to the Science Museum in late 1926 and early 1927. It was completely disassembled, the parts thoroughly cleaned and preserved, and all new fabric covering applied. A careful search was made to locate new fabric that matched the original as closely as possible. When the fabric was replaced in 1927, it was sewn on in a slightly different way than originally done by the brothers in 1903. When stitching the new fabric in 1985, a large section of original flown 1903 wing covering was available and used as a pattern, ensuring the accuracy of the 1985 restoration."},{"label":"Alternate Name","content":"1903 Wright Flyer"},{"label":"Key Accomplishment(s)","content":"First Successful Powered Airplane with a Pilot Aboard"},{"label":"Brief Description","content":"Wilbur and Orville Wright spent four years of research and development to create the first successful powered airplane, the 1903 Wright Flyer.

The M-2 was a single-bay biplane with the conventional form of axleless undercarriage. The fuselage, a truss of steel tubes and tie rods, was made in two detachable sections. The engine section was detachable at the station at the front wing beam and the engine cowling was hinged to facilitate inspection. The fuselage aft of the firewall was covered with fabric. The wings, vertical fin, and horizontal stabilizer were of standard wood beam and built-up rib construction, with the elevators and rudder made of Duralumin tubing. The power plant was a 400-hp, Liberty water-cooled engine, with nose radiator. Two main fuel tanks, each of sixty gallons capacity and made of sheet aluminum, were so mounted in the lower wing that they could be jettisoned by the pilot. A small 10-gallon gravity tank was located in the upper wing."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"A design detail of particular interest was the location and construction of the M-2 mail compartment. It was situated in front of the pilots cockpit, sealed from the engine by a fireproof bulkhead, and lined with reinforced Duralumin. It was six feet long, had a capacity of 58 cubic feet, and could carry up to 1,000 pounds of mail. A unique feature was the provision of two removable seats that permitted carrying passengers or reserve pilots from one field to another. The passengers were seated well down in the compartment and protected by suitable windshields. Access was provided by the use of aluminum covers over the top, arranged and constructed so that, with passengers aboard, the roof door could be folded down. providing a cockpit opening."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Flights were scheduled daily in both directions on the Los Angeles-to-Salt Lake City run, with one-way flight time averaging slightly in excess of six hours. The record time for the route was 4 hours, 12 minutes. The schedule was maintained by four regular pilots, two reserve pilots, eight mechanics, and three radio operators at the fields. Although transporting the mail remained the airlines’ chief concern, Western Air Express invited passenger traffic, and invaluable experience was gained flying passengers in the M-2 over the same rugged territory of eastern California. southern Nevada, and western Utah traveled many years before by the Mormons."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The M-2 performed remarkably well during the early years on the CAM-4 route. Its load-carrying capability, remarkable stability, and rugged construction contributed to a perfect safety record and profitable operation. Government and airline experiences with the Douglas mailplanes and the 0-2 led to modifications of the basic design. Relatively minor changes in cockpit layout, engine accessories, and airframe construction led to the M-3 mailplane, which differed little in physical appearance from the M-2 version. A subsequent addition of five feet to the wingspan resulted in the final version, the M-4, which realized considerable gain in payload at a negligible loss in performance. While Western eventually added two M-4s to its fleet of six M-2s, the M-4 saw more extensive service with National Air Transport (later United Air Lines) from 1927 to 1930 on the Chicago-New York route. National Air Transport modified all of its M-3s into the M-4 configuration and eventually had twenty-four Douglas mailplanes on its roster, to become the largest operator of this type in commercial service."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The M-2 of the National Air and Space Museum is believed to be the last Douglas mailplane in existence.

The aircraft saw considerable service on Western’s mail route until 1930. when it crashed and was sold to Continental Air Map Company of Los Angeles. The airplane had a series of corporate and private owners until it was reacquired by Western Air Lines in April 1940 and subsequently registered with the Federal Aviation Administration as M-2 NC15O, Western’s first M-2. The first substantial restoration took place in 1946, although no attempt was made to make it flyable.

The Bristol Jupiter engine was replaced with a nine-cylinder 700 hp Wright Cyclone radial engine and a smooth short-chord Townend ring cowl. The fuselage was rebuilt using the existing truss structure that was then covered over with the faired aluminum skin that is still on the present airplane. In 1933 he negotiated a deal with the Gulf Oil Company to start an aviation department with himself as manager. The aircraft was repainted with the now famous Gulfhawk orange, white and blue sunburst paint scheme. He flew the airplane on the show circuit under Gulf sponsorship through 1936 when he replaced it with the Grumman Gulfhawk II, also in NASM's collection. Williams also wrote a syndicated column for Scripps Howard newspapers, continually advocating the future of air power and the need for strong military air forces.

A four-year restoration project began to replace the engine, rudder, rudder pedals, elevators, instruments, and throttle quadrant. Most of the fabric covering was gone and the fuselage was so heavily dented that almost all of the skin panels had to be replaced.

It played a major role throughout the Pacific. On June 4, 1942, during the Battle of Midway, SBDs destroyed four Japanese carriers, dramatically altering the course of the war."},{"label":"Summary","content":"The SBD's design was based on the Northrop BT-1, but with engine and structural changes. Production orders were placed in April 1939, with all SBD-1s going to U.S. Marine Corps units. Subsequent models were sent to Navy squadrons, with each succeeding model carrying such improvements as increased fuel capacity, illuminated gunsights, and armor plates for the crew. England, New Zealand, and France also used SBDs. The SBD-6 was the last production model, with 450 built."},{"label":"Summary","content":"This SBD-6 carries the markings of VS-51 (Navy scout squadron), which operated in the Pacific during World War II."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Douglas SBD Dauntless played one of the most significant roles in the course of World War II. Although considered obsolete and scheduled for replacement before the war began, the SBD would live up to the nickname given to it by its crews - Slow But Deadly (a play on its official designation). Serving throughout the war, Dauntlesses would sink more than 300,000 tons of enemy shipping, including at least 18 warships, ranging from submarines to battleships. During 1942, SBDs were the primary weapon in the U.S. war effort in the Pacific, almost single-handedly sinking six enemy carriers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Navy experience with dive bombing went back to the early years of naval aviation. United States Marine Corps pilots had experimented with the technique as early as 1919 although it was not known by that name at the time. With the commissioning of the first carrier, the USS Langley, the Navy realized there would be limitations to the size of aircraft used at sea. Carrier planes could not hope to carry the same bomb load as shore-based aircraft, so they needed to be able to deliver each bomb as accurately as possible. Dive bombing was the answer. The technique gained official status in 1926 when the Navy included it in the fleet exercises. Accidents involving the bomb hitting the propeller or wheels on release, however, nearly ended its use. A solution was found in a bomb fork, which swung the bomb clear of the propeller arc. Approval followed in 1931."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In 1934 the Bureau of Aeronautics held a design competition for a new generation of carrier aircraft. The Navy wished to replace its four main types - fighter, scout-bomber, torpedo bomber, and dive bomber - with modern all-metal monoplane aircraft. Designs by Vought, Brewster, and Northrop were chosen for further development in the dive bomber category. Brewster lacked the facilities to meet the Navy's needs and the Vought design did not have the necessary performance, although 50 would later be ordered as the SB2U Vindicator."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Northrop entry bore a family resemblance to the firm's Alpha series of mailplane aircraft. Chief engineer Ed Heinemann's racy low-wing monoplane design incorporated many of the revolutionary construction techniques used in the earlier aircraft. Unlike the Vought entry, the XBT-1 (as the Northrop aircraft was designated), in an effort to save weight, did not include folding wings. Split dive flaps on the trailing edge of the wing, which were perforated, eliminated tail buffeting and permitted a steeper diving angle. The Navy approved the design and ordered 54 production models designated as BT-1s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The BT-1, however, had stability problems and with an 825 horsepower Pratt & Whitney engine, was underpowered. A second prototype, the XBT-2, incorporated the new 1,000 horsepower Wright R-1820-32 engine, which boosted the BT-1's top speed of 212 mph by 35 mph. The addition of a modified rudder corrected poor lateral stability. A fully retractable landing gear was also included on the new prototype. The new design featured improved stability and low-speed control."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"During the development of the XBT-2, Douglas took over the Northrop contract. Many Northrop employees, including engineer Ed Heinemann, moved over with the project, and in 1938, Northrop sold his El Segundo, California factory to Douglas. With the switch in manufacturers the XBT-2 became the XSBD-1 (for Experimental Scout-Bomber Douglas -1). After some more minor modifications, the Navy ordered 144 SBDs in April 1939. In common with other Douglas aircraft whose names began with the letter \"D\", the SBD was named the Dauntless."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Although the Navy had placed an order, it did not consider the SBD-1 to be fully combat-ready. The main problem was a lack of fuel capacity, which limited the range of the Dauntless. With the amount of time spent forming up and landing on a carrier, fuel capacity was considered to be critical. Douglas agreed to address the problem, beginning with the 58th production model. The Navy agreed to accept the first 57 SBD-1s without modification and decided that the Marines, who mostly operated from land bases, could use these aircraft. The Marines, therefore, received the first Dauntlesses in June of 1940."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The remaining 87 aircraft of the original contract were delivered as SBD-2s. While the modifications of this version did not solve all the problems, they did improve on the lack of range. In this model, the two small 15-gallon auxiliary fuel tanks located in the wing center section of the SBD-1 were replaced with two 65-gallon tanks in the outer wings. Fuel capacity was increased from 210 to 310 gallons and range increased to 1,200 miles. The SBD-2 also had an autopilot for the long over-water flights that were now possible. The increased weight, however, hurt performance and often one of the two .50 caliber fuselage-mounted guns would be removed to compensate. Deliveries of the SBD-2 to VS-2 and VB-2 on board the USS Lexington began in November 1940, with USS Enterprises's VS-6 and VB-6 following shortly."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The initial two models of the Dauntless would see the first combat in the Pacific on 7 December 1941, during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Marine Air Group (MAG) 11 - equipped with the SBD-1 - was caught on the ground and all aircraft were either damaged or destroyed by the Japanese. At the same time, 18 Navy SBD-2s, launched from the Enterprise, which was returning to Hawaii from Wake Island, arrived just as the Japanese were attacking. Seven Dauntlesses were shot down or crash-landed. Two Japanese aircraft were claimed shot down by the Dauntlesses. Three days later the SBD gained the distinction of destroying the first Japanese warship of World War II when Lt Dickinson of VS-6 sank the Imperial Japanese submarine I-70 off of Hawaii."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As 1942 began, it was obvious that any retaliation for Pearl Harbor would have to come from the carrier forces, which had been at sea during the attack and had therefore avoided destruction. The first action took the form of hit-and-run raids by the carriers Enterprise, Lexington, and Yorktown, against remote Japanese positions in the spring of 1942. While these raids caused little damage, they served notice that the U. S. Navy was still fighting. Dauntlesses were heavily involved and attacked many ships and shore installations in these raids. One of the most famous strikes of this period was the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. An SBD reported a Japanese picket boat ahead of the task force. The Dauntless crew also reported that the boat had probably sighted them, thus precipitating the early launch of Doolittle's B-25 bombers."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Deliveries of the new SBD-3 began in March 1941, and were stepped up after the attack on Pearl Harbor, so that this was the main type to be used throughout the major battles of 1942. The SBD-3 brought the Dauntless up to full combat standards. Self-sealing wing tanks, crew armor, and an armored windscreen were all introduced. Experience gained in the Battle of the Coral Sea prompted the introduction of twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear cockpit, thus increasing firepower. They were made standard in mid-production and earlier examples of the SBD-3 were retrofitted with the guns in the field. The added weight of these improvements was offset to a certain extent by the use of alclad to replace the dural skin of the earlier models, and the removal of the flotation equipment that was standard on the SBD-2. Maximum speed fell by a small margin to 250 mph, earning this model the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \" The Speedy Three\". Service ceiling, however, improved from 26,000 to 27,100 ft."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In May 1942, the U.S. faced its first major operation against the Japanese fleet at the Battle of the Coral Sea. The battle resulted when Admiral Nimitz sent Yorktown and Lexington to block the Japanese thrust towards Australia. In this, the world's first carrier duel in which the opposing ships never came within sight of each other, Dauntlesses were responsible for sinking the Japanese small carrier Shoho. Despite the fact that the Japanese sank the larger U.S. fleet carrier Lexington, the battle was a strategic victory for the Americans because it stopped the Japanese move to the south. In less than a month's time, Dauntlesses would improve on their Coral Sea performance."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"With the failure of the southern expedition, the Japanese decided to strike at the U.S. base on Midway Island. The plan was to gain a base from where they could threaten the Hawaiian Islands and thus draw the remaining U.S. carriers out to be destroyed in a major fleet engagement. The U.S. Navy had an advantage in that they had broken the Japanese code and knew the attack was coming. Also, the Japanese did not realize that Yorktown, which had been damaged (and believed sunk) at Coral Sea, had been hastily repaired and was able to join Enterprise and Hornet at Midway. The three U.S. carriers carried 112 Dauntlesses. Most were the latest model, but a few SBD-1s and -2s were also aboard. While the Japanese had a much larger fleet, the sides were more evenly matched in the crucial area of airpower. The Japanese had four aircraft carriers, and the U.S. had three carriers and the land-based aircraft at Midway, which included 19 SBD-2s."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By June 3, the American carriers were ready and had spotted the enemy troop transports. The next day the Japanese opened the battle with a strike on Midway. Meanwhile, a PBY Catalina had spotted the Japanese fleet and the U.S. carriers began to launch their aircraft. Because of the varying launch times and speeds of the different aircraft, the TBD torpedo planes were the first to attack the Japanese carriers. The slow Devastators were easy targets for the Japanese fighters and were soon beaten back with no damage to the carriers. Because of the uncoordinated nature of the attack, the SBD squadrons had trouble finding the carriers. The Hornet SBD's never found the carriers. Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, the Commander of the Enterprise's Air Group, however, made a navigational guess that brought his VS-6 and VB-6 right over the Japanese carriers. The attacking TBDs had drawn down the Japanese fighter screen and the Dauntlesses found the targets wide open. Japanese indecision as to whether to launch further strikes on the island or to attack the recently discovered American carriers, left bombs and torpedoes, along with aviation fuel, scattered on the carriers' decks. At the same time as McClusky's group attacked, VB-3 from Yorktown arrived. The combined onslaught rained 39 bombs on three Japanese carriers in three to four minutes, and 11 direct hits mortally damaged the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. The fourth carrier, Hiryu, was located later and was also sunk by Dauntlesses. Japan lost four carriers and many of its experienced aviators for the loss of 35 Dauntlesses from the six Navy and one Marine SBD squadrons engaged. The SBD had stopped the Japanese and allowed the U.S. to fight on an equal footing in the Pacific."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Dauntless would also play a significant part in the first major American offensive, the fight for Guadalcanal. Marine SBDs based on the island attacked Japanese ships, which were known as the \"Tokyo Express\", that were attempting to reinforce the island. Ship-based SBDs also participated in the eastern Solomon's campaign, of which Guadalcanal was a part, and sank another Japanese carrier."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"While the SBD is most often associated with the Pacific theater of operations, it did serve in a limited capacity in the Atlantic. In November 1942, Dauntlesses flew from the carrier Ranger and the escort carriers Sangamon and Santee in support of Operation TORCH, the invasion of North Africa. In contrast with the naval actions of the Pacific, SBD attacks were mostly against ground targets in support of the Allied landings. They were, however, called upon to attack seven Vichy French cruisers that set out to attack the Allied troopships. On November 10, nine SBDs from the Ranger sank the moored battleship Jean Bart which had been firing on the invasion fleet. With the sinking of the Japanese battleship Hiei in the Pacific three days earlier, this was the second enemy battleship sunk by Dauntlesses within one week."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"SBDs from Santee also conducted anti-submarine patrols in the Atlantic during 1943, but the TBM Avenger was better suited and was used more often for this type of work. Marine Dauntlesses operated in the patrol and scouting role from the Virgin Islands until mid 1944. The last offensive mission for the Dauntless in the Atlantic was an attack on enemy shipping in Norway called Operation LEADER. SBDs from the carrier Ranger attacked several ships in Bodo harbor and roadstead. They sank two ships, shared in the destruction of two more, and damaged a further two."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Douglas continued to modify the Dauntless throughout the war in an attempt to improve performance. The SBD-4 was introduced in late 1942. It had an improved 24-volt electrical system that allowed for the installation of radar. It also featured a Hamilton-Standard Hydromatic propeller. But, at 245 mph maximum speed, this was also the slowest version. Early in 1943 the SBD-5, with a larger engine, started to enter squadron service. Two additions that increased bombing accuracy were the replacement of the telescopic sight of the early models with a reflector sight and a heated windscreen, which overcame the fogging that had been common in the dive run. Radar was also more commonly seen on this model. The additional weight of the extra equipment, however, largely cancelled out the increased horsepower."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The SBD-5 was the most produced variant of the Dauntless and served throughout the battles of 1943. The last version of the Dauntless, the SBD-6 featured a larger engine, which raised top speed to 262 mph, and service ceiling to 28,600 ft. In all other ways, however, it differed little from the previous model. By the time it entered production, the Helldiver was replacing the Dauntless in the fleet and the SBD-6 remained, for the most part, stateside."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"By June 1943 the U.S. Navy had four new, large, Essex-class CV carriers. The Helldiver was supposed to be the dive-bomber assigned to the new carriers, but in the summer of 1943 it was not ready for combat. The Dauntless therefore soldiered on. Its role on the new carriers changed however. The new CVs could carry 100 airplanes, compared to 80 on the older carriers, and the scout squadrons were eliminated. The difference in airplanes was made up by an increase in the numbers of fighters. Scout duties were now taken over by the Hellcats and Avengers, both of which had long range capabilities. From then on, Dauntlesses would serve almost exclusively as strike aircraft. SBDs continued to fly throughout 1943 and not until late in the year did the SB2C Helldiver finally enter service. Many navy pilots did not see the Helldiver as much of an improvement over the Dauntless. Pilots preferred the SBD's more responsive controls which made it an easy plane to fly when lightly loaded. The Douglas aircraft also required less maintenance hours than did the Curtiss."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Despite the introduction of the Helldiver, Dauntlesses continued in Navy service until July 1944 when they participated in their last mission during an attack on Guam. The Marines continued to use them in the Philippines campaign. By the end of World War II, most Dauntlesses had been relegated to the training and utility roles. A few Marine SBDs, however, were still at work neutralizing bypassed garrisons in the Solomons until the end of the war."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Dauntless was not only used by the U.S. Navy, but also by the Army. The success of the German dive-bombers during the early years of the war in Europe convinced some army leaders of the need for a U.S. version. Limited experience with this type of aircraft and no time to develop a new design, however, dictated that the United States Army Air Force (USAAF) place orders for the Navy's SBD. In Army service it was know as the A-24 Banshee. The main differences with the Dauntless were the lack of a tailhook, and a larger pneumatic tailwheel. The Banshee was delivered as the A-24, A-24A, and A-24B, which were equivalent to the SBD-3, -4, and -5. The idea of dive-bombing was not widely supported in the USAAF, however, and the Banshee was not used extensively."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"In addition to the United States, New Zealand (in the Solomons) and the Free French (in Europe) also flew SBDs. As late as 1949 the French were using SBDs to carry out attacks on Communist terrorists in Indo-China. Mexico flew Banshees, which it had received for patrol missions in the Gulf of Mexico during World War II, as border patrol planes until 1959."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"NASM's Dauntless, Bureau Number 54605, was the sixth SBD-6 model produced. It was accepted by the U.S. Navy on March 30, 1944, and delivered a week later on April 7. It spent its entire operational career at Naval Air Station Patuxent River, Maryland. From August to September 1944 it was used for tactical tests. From October 1944 to April 1948 it was used for flight tests. In May 1948 it was put in storage at NAS Weeksville, North Carolina. Stricken from Navy service June 30, 1948, it was earmarked for the national collection. This was perhaps the last SBD to serve with the U.S. Navy. Dauntless 54605 was accessioned by the Smithsonian in 1961 and restored in 1975.

Worldwide, fighter aircraft designs matured rapidly during the late 1930s and it was soon obvious that the P-36 was no match for newer European designs. High altitude performance in particular became a priceless commodity. Berlin attempted to improve the P-36 by redesigning it in to accommodate a turbo-supercharged Allison V-1710-11 inline, liquid-cooled engine. The new aircraft was designated the XP-37 but proved unpopular with pilots. The turbo-supercharger was not reliable and Berlin had placed the cockpit too far back on the fuselage, restricting the view to the front of the fighter. Nonetheless, when the engine was not giving trouble, the more-streamlined XP-37 was much faster than the P-36."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"Curtiss tried again in 1938. Berlin had modified another P-36 with a new Allison V-1710-19 engine. It was designated the XP-40 and first flew on October 14, 1938. The XP-40 looked promising and Curtiss offered it to Army Air Corps leaders who evaluated the airplane at Wright Field, Ohio, in 1939, along with several other fighter proposals. The P-40 won the competition, after some modifications, and Curtiss received an order for 540. At this time, the armament package consisted of two .50 caliber machine guns in the fuselage and four .30 caliber machine guns in the wings."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"After production began in March 1940, France ordered 140 P-40s but the British took delivery of these airplanes when Paris surrendered. The British named the aircraft Tomahawks but found they performed poorly in high-altitude combat over northern Europe and relegated them to low-altitude operations in North Africa. The Russians bought more than 2,000 P-40s but details of their operational history remain obscure."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"When the United States declared war, P-40s equipped many of the Army Air Corps's front line fighter units. The plucky fighter eventually saw combat in almost every theater of operations being the most effective in the China-Burma-India (CBI) Theater. Of all the CBI groups that gained the most notoriety of the entire war, and remains to this day synonymous with the P-40, is the American Volunteer Group (AVG) or the Flying Tigers. The unit was organized after the Chinese gave former U. S. Army Air Corps Captain Claire Lee Chennault almost 9 million dollars in 1940 to buy aircraft and recruit pilots to fly against the Japanese. Chennault's most important support within the Chinese government came from Madam Chiang Kai-shek, a Lt. Colonel in the Chinese Air Force and for a time, the service's overall commander."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The money from China diverted an order placed by the British Royal Air Force for 100 Curtiss-Wright P-40B Tomahawks but buying airplanes was only one important step in creating a fighting air unit. Trained pilots were needed, and quickly, as tensions across the Pacific escalated. On April 15, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt quietly signed an Executive Order permitting Chennault to recruit directly from the ranks of American military reserve pilots. Within a few months, 350 flyers joined from pursuit (fighter), bomber, and patrol squadrons. In all, about half the pilots in the Flying Tigers came from the U. S. Navy and Marine Corps while the Army Air Corps supplied one-third. Factory test pilots at Bell, Consolidated, and other companies, and commercial airline pilots, filled the remaining slots."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Flying Tigers flew their first mission on December 20. The unit's name was derived from the ferocious fangs and teeth painted on the nose of AVG P-40s at either side of the distinctive, large radiator air intake. The idea is said to originate from pictures in a magazine that showed Royal Air Force Tomahawks of No. 112 Squadron, operating in the western desert of North Africa, adorned with fangs and teeth painted around their air intakes. The Flying Tigers were the first real opposition the Japanese military encountered. In less than 7 months of action, AVG pilots destroyed about 115 Japanese aircraft and lost only 11 planes in air-to-air combat. The AVG disbanded on July 4, 1942, and its assets, including a few pilots, became a part of the U. S. Army Air Forces (AAF) 23rd Fighter Group in the newly activated 14th Air Force. Chennault, now a Brigadier General, assumed command of the 14th AF and by war's end, the 23rd was one of the highest-scoring Army fighter groups."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"As wartime experience in the P-40 mounted, Curtiss made many modifications. Engineers added armor plate, better self-sealing fuel tanks, and more powerful engines. They modified the cockpit to improve visibility and changed the armament package to six, wing-mounted, .50 caliber machine guns. The P-40E Kittyhawk was the first model with this gun package and it entered service in time to serve in the AVG. The last model produced in quantity was the P-40N, the lightest P-40 built in quantity, and much faster than previous models. Curtiss built a single P-40Q. It was the fastest P-40 to fly (679 kph/422 mph) but it could not match the performance of the P-47 Thunderbolt and the P-51 Mustang so Curtiss ended development of the P-40 series with this model. In addition to the AAF, many Allied nations bought and flew P-40s including England, France, China, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, and Turkey."},{"label":"Long Description","content":"The Smithsonian P-40E did not serve in the U. S. military. Curtiss-Wright built it in Buffalo, New York, as Model 87-A3 and delivered it to Canada as a Kittyhawk IA on March 11, 1941. It served in No. 111 Squadron, Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF). When the Japanese navy moved to attack Midway, they sent a diversionary battle group to menace the Aleutian Islands. Canada moved No. 111 Squadron to Alaska to help defend the region. After the Japanese threat diminished, the unit returned to Canada and eventually transferred to England without its P-40s. The RCAF declared the NASM Kittyhawk IA surplus on July 27, 1946, and the aircraft eventually returned to the United States. It had several owners before ending up with the Explorer Scouts youth group in Meridian, Mississippi. During the early 1960s, the Smithsonian began searching for a P-40 with a documented history of service in the AVG but found none. In 1964, the Exchange Club in Meridian donated the Kittyhawk IA to the National Aeronautical Collection, in memory of Mr. Kellis Forbes, a local man devoted to Boys Club activities. A U. S. Air Force Reserve crew airlifted the fighter to Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland, on March 13, 1964. Andrews personnel restored the airplane in 1975 and painted it to represent an aircraft of the 75th Fighter Squadron, 23rd Fighter Group, 14th Air Force."}]},{"id":"ld1-1643400021979-1643400042093-0","title":"Fuel Cell, Apollo","link":"http://n2t.net/ark:/65665/nv9e4cc07a9-4f73-4e67-8af9-d3cf2706a6e7","description":[{"label":"Summary","content":"The Apollo Command Module's primary source of electric power was from a set of three \"fuel cells\" housed in the Service Module.

The Italians and Portuguese were also discussing plans for a round-the-world flight at this time.

A total of five airplanes were built, including a prototype for testing.

Engine trouble forced him down and the other World Cruisers continued on. After an engine replacement, Martin and his mechanic, Sgt. Alva Harvey, attempting to catch up with the others waiting at Dutch Harbor, Alaska, departed in questionable weather. The Seattle crashed into a mountainside after getting lost in fog. The airplane was destroyed, but luckily Martin and Harvey escaped with minor injuries. Lt.
