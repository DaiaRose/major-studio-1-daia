The objective was a power plant for large seaplanes, such as the British Naval Air Forces used in patrolling the North Sea for enemy submarines. The quickest way to develop such an engine was thought to be through enlarging the 8-cylinder Curtiss VX engine into a 12-cylinder version. The first 12-cylinder Curtiss engine was designated V-4."

This project, originally not intended to support Apollo, was reconfigured in 1962 and 1963 to further the presidential mandate by mapping the surface. In addition to a powerful camera that could send photographs to Earth tracking stations, it carried three scientific experiments-selnodesy (the Lunar equivalent of geodesy), meteoroid detection, and radiation measurement. It helped to scout the lunar surface, down to one-meter resolution, and identify potential landing sites.

NASA launched the five Lunar Orbiter satellites between 10 August 1966 and 1 August 1967, all successfully achieving their objectives. In total, they mapped roughly 99 percent of the lunar surface. Lunar Orbiter 1 became the first spacecraft to take a picture of the Earth from the Moon, preempting the famous \"Earthrise\" photograph of Apollo 8 by more than two years. But this Lunar Orbiter image, for all of its significance did not have the salience of the more famous image in part because it was not full color. At the completion of the third mission, moreover, the Apollo planners announced that they had sufficient data to press on with an astronaut landing, and were able to use the last two missions for other activities. They conducted more general scientific surveys and also mapped the lunar gravitational field. For example, Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and 95 percent of the farside, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the farside coverage and acquired up to two-meter resolution images of 36 pre-selected areas."

This required the spacecraft to move slightly whenever its shutters were opened to prevent blurring.

        "content": "Frenchman Henri Mignet designed the HM.14 Pou du Ciel (Flying Flea) in 1933. He envisioned a simple aircraft that amateurs could build and even teach themselves to fly. In an attempt to render the aircraft stall-proof and safe for amateur pilots to fly, Mignet staggered the two main wings. The HM.14 enjoyed a period of intense popularity in France and England but a series of accidents in 1935-36 permanently blackened the airplane's reputation."

Edward Nirmaier and two other men built the airplane in November 1935 for Nirmaier's boss, Powel Crosley, Jr. Crosley was president of the Crosley Radio Corporation. He believed that the Flea might become a popular aircraft in the United States. After several flights, a crash at the Miami Air Races in December 1935 grounded the Crosley HM.14 for good. In 1960 Patrick H. \"Pat\" Packard donated this Pou du Ciel to the Smithsonian. In 1987 Packard and Patti Koppa finished restoring the aircraft. The original ABC Scorpion engine was missing, so these two artisans fabricated a wooden replica."

He sought to give everyone access to the skies at a time when flying was the exclusive province of professional pilots. Pou du Ciel ('poo-do-say,' literally \"Sky Louse\" but the English coined the term \"Flying Flea\") is an appropriate name for this small, unusual aircraft. The novelty of the HM.14, along with Mignet's effective marketing, compelled hundreds of people to build and fly the Pou du Ciel in France and Britain during the 1930s."

He became interested in aviation as a teenager and by age eighteen, he was corresponding with Gustav Lilienthal (brother to Otto, the famous German glider pioneer) about building aircraft. After World War I, Mignet began to experiment with powered aircraft. His first designs barely flew but in 1927 he built the HM.8, his first design capable of sustained flight."

In Britain and France, the established manufacturers dominated the production of powered aircraft. Mignet decided to publicize the HM. 8 in the French magazine \"Les Ailes.\" Interest in this aircraft began to grow, encouraging Mignet to write another article that appeared in \"Le Sport de l'Air\" in 1931."

He decided this airplane could fly without ailerons, elevator, and rudder pedals, and that he would use two main wings. He mounted one on struts above the fuselage and ahead of the pilot. To control pitch, the pilot pivoted this wing by moving a control stick fore and aft. Mignet mounted a second wing firmly fixed to the top of the fuselage behind the pilot. To turn, the pilot moved a rudder surface by swinging the control stick left or right. A generous amount of dihedral built into both wings caused the airplane to automatically bank when turning. Mignet claimed that any man who could nail shut a wooden crate could build his own HM. 14."

After publishing a book in November 1934 that described in detail how to build this airplane, public interest skyrocketed. By March 1935, 500 HM.14s were under construction in France. In August, Mignet flew his HM.14 to Britain and soon gained widespread attention. Construction began on hundreds of HM.14 airplanes and builder/pilots received permits to fly more than 80. The Flea's performance appealed to many; the maximum speed of the average Flea was between 80 and 105 km/h (50-65 mph), depending on the engine, the flying weight, and the quality of construction. A pilot could fly from 80 to 161 km (50-100 miles) before needing to refuel and she could usually take off in less than about 180 m or 600 ft."

        "content": "During the same month that Mignet introduced the \"Pou du Ciel\" to Great Britain, the first fatal crash of a Flying Flea happened in Algeria. In April 1936 the first British fatality occurred. The authorities saw pilot incompetence as a leading factor in the crashes until May 1936 when Royal Air Force Squadron Leader C.R. Davidson died. Government officials in both France and Britain banned flights and subjected the HM.14 to wind tunnel tests. The results showed that under certain flight conditions, the pilot could not recover from a dive. Based on their findings, Mignet soon modified the design and solved most of the problems but the bubble of public infatuation with the Flea had burst. He continued his efforts to produce new aircraft and built a factory in the United States to make parts, but Mignet never recaptured the initial public interest first shown the HM.14."

With the help of Dan Boedeker and Herb Junkin, Nirmaier began construction on October 1, 1935. Funded by Crosley, he used materials readily available near the airport at Sharonville, Ohio. He even scrounged an ABC Scorpion engine. Nirmaier made the first test flight exactly one month later on November 1. This became the first HM.14 built in the United States. Nirmaier had adhered closely to Mignet's plans in constructing the aircraft, deviating only in the methods used to weld several parts. Powel's daughter, Page, christened the plane La Cucaracha (The Cockroach) using a bottle containing water from the Atlantic Ocean near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. This was the site of the first successful flight of a powered, heavier-than-air flying machine, the 1903 Wright Flyer (see NASM collection). The U. S. Bureau of Air Commerce licensed the airplane as the experimental Crosley Flea."

It flew well, but on the first day, a gust of wind flipped it over while taxiing. Nirmaier quickly repaired the damage and took the aircraft aloft for a short flight two days later. This became the Crosley Flea's last flight. Meet organizers awarded the HM.14 a trophy (see NASM collection) for efficient construction and operation, but the aircraft remained grounded for good."

They saved the Flea and placed the small aircraft in a barn owned by insurance adjuster Walter Paner. It remained there until 1957 when vintage aircraft enthusiast Patrick Packard tracked it down. He purchased the Flea minus its wheels and engine but Pat located Ed Nirmaier and reclaimed the original wheels that Nirmaier had installed on his lawnmower. Pat donated the aircraft to the Smithsonian in about 1960. In 1991 the Experimental Aircraft Association Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, borrowed the Flea and Pat Packard and Patti Koppa undertook a full restoration. Pat reproduced an accurate wooden replica of the missing, original ABC Scorpion engine."

It used an automobile rear wheel and a motorcycle front wheel. The tires were manufactured by B.F. Goodrich. The machine was not equipped with any suspension system at all.

The two instructors led a group of students who built the Super Sailplane in 1932. The wing of the Super was nearly a copy of the wing used on the German \"Wein\" sailplane designed and flown with great success in 1930 and 1931 by Robert Kronfeld. Both the Super Sailplane and the Senior Albatross employed the same Goettingen 549 wing airfoil and even the tips of the control surfaces curved to almost identical contours.

The compression strut changes consisted of moving them upward to where the struts attach to the fuselage. Additional instruments were added to the basic instrument group, including a wet compass, fuel gauge, voltmeter, an additional altimeter and an antenna on the turtleback. The Museum removed the compass and antenna (now in storage) to return the aircraft to a more original look. A radio was also installed at some time but was missing when the airplane was received by the museum. The aircraft had 174 hours and 10 minutes recorded time on May 20, 1982, when the airplane was still in England, but no further recorded time can be found. It is located at the Steven F.

On September 9, 1942, a Yokosuka E14Y1 GLEN (Allied codename) reconnaissance floatplane launched by catapult from the submarine I-25 and dropped four improvised phosphorus bombs into a forest on the Oregon coast. Five months earlier, the Japanese Navy issued orders to build a new series of submarine aircraft carriers called the I-400 class. Navy planners envisioned a large fleet but eventually only three were completed, I-400 through I-402. The three ships in this class were the largest submarines ever built until the \"USS Lafayette\" sailed in 1962. An I-400 boat displaced 5,970 metric tons (6,560 tons) submerged and it cruised at 18.7 knots surfaced. These ships could travel 60,000 km (43,000 mi) carrying three Seirans in waterproof compartments. A class of smaller Japanese submarines called the AM class was also modified to carry two Seirans."

Chief engineer Ozaki confronted an ambitious challenge: develop an aircraft to haul a 250 kg (400 lb) bomb, or an 800 kg (1,288 lb) bomb or torpedo, and fly at least 474 kph (294 mph) with jettisonable floats in place, or 559 kph (347 mph) without floats. The navy also stipulated that assembling and launching the three M6A1s should require no more than 30 minutes. To fit inside a 3.5 m (11 ft 6 in) diameter, cylinder-shaped hangar, Ozaki designed the main wing spar to rotate 90° once the deck crew removed the two floats. After rotating the wings, the crew folded them back to lie flat against the fuselage. About 2/3 of the each side of the horizontal stabilizer also folded down, likewise the tip of the vertical stabilizer. Deck crews stored the floats and their support pylons in separate compartments."

The Navy was so pleased with the initial results that it ordered production to start even before Aichi delivered the remaining prototypes, and two land-based M6A1-K Nanzan trainers. However, progress virtually stopped after a major earthquake severely disrupted the production line in December 1944. Boeing B-29 bomber raids further disrupted the project. As the war deteriorated in March 1945, the Navy curtailed the submarine program. The first I-400 was finished on December 30, 1944, and the I-401 followed a week later. But I-402 was converted into a submarine fuel tanker and work ended on I-404 and 405. With the submarine fleet now reduced, the Navy required fewer Seirans so this program was also curtailed. Using parts on hand, Aichi eventually built 26 Seirans (including prototypes) and two Nanzan trainers."

The combined force consisted of the submarine carriers I-400 and I-401, two AM class submarines, the I-13 and I-14, and 10 Seiran bombers. During sea trials, the units practiced hard to reduce the assembly time for the Seiran. Eventually, the crews could launch three aircraft (albeit without floats) in less than 15 minutes! There was a major drawback for without floats, the Seiran pilot could not safely land on the water. His only option was to ditch the bomber near the submarine and await rescue. The aircraft would obviously be lost."

Japanese Navy planners chose to strike the locks of the Panama Canal using the 631st Air Corps embarked aboard the 1st Submarine Flotilla. Planners assigned ten Seirans to strike the Gatun Locks with six torpedoes and four bombs. The pilots studied a large-scale model of the lock system and memorized important features of the canal, just as their predecessors did before attacking Pearl Harbor. During these preparations, the Japanese decided to strike first at the U. S. Navy fleet anchored at Ulithi Atoll. On June 25, 1945, Ariizumi received orders for Operation Hikari. This plan required six Seirans and four Nakajima C6N1 MYRT reconnaissance aircraft (see NASM collection). The I-13 and I-14 would carry two MYRTs each and offload them at Truk Island. The MYRT pilots would take off and scout the American fleet at Ulithi, relaying target information to the Seiran crews. The six Seirans would carry out kamikaze attacks on the most important targets-American aircraft carriers and troop transports."

They found interesting design features built into the Seiran that ranged in engineering quality from the ingenious to the seemingly absurd. This artifact also bore witness to the difficult working conditions that plagued the Japanese aviation industry at the end of the war. Quality and workmanship were seriously lacking because of extensive damage to equipment and factories and the lack of skilled, professional workers (many were high school students). A metal flap bore damage-probably the result of a bombing raid-hastily covered with fabric patches. They found the interior of fuel tanks contaminated with paper documents. Basic fit and alignment of parts was also poor in many places. Someone, possibly a Japanese student, scratched a complete English alphabet inside one wing panel.

Early in 1963, the Grafton Water Ski Club in New South Wales, Australia, asked Dickenson to build a kite for an upcoming water ski festival. Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite. He made and tested models of a Rogallo-type wing and they showed improved stability, but control was little better than the classic ski kite."

Dickenson’s idea was brilliant and simple, and added little weight. It consisted of a control bar and a seat or harness suspended from the keel tube by a strap. He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and just behind the control bar, and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips. From the hanging strap, he suspended the pilot’s seat. The strap supported the pilot like a pendulum and allowed him or her to shift their weight with ease, pushing and pulling the control bar to make the glider climb, dive, or turn."

On September 8, 1963, as John Dickenson looked on, a ski boat towed his friend Rod Fuller aloft for the first flight of a Rogallo-type wing ski kite with the improved Dickenson control system. By 1966, Dickenson was selling his adaptation of the Rogallo-type wing ski kite fitted with his new control system, and in 1967, he introduced fellow Australian Bill Bennett to the booming sport of flying ski-kites. Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name. The excitement of flying and the ease of access to flight provided by the Rogallo wing with Dickenson control appealed to the freewheeling sport leisure culture of the late 1960s, and across America, Bennett's kites grew in popularity."

Bennett developed five lighter variations of the tow-kites specifically adapted for foot launching. The Rogallo wings with 80 or 90-degree nose angles became known as standard Rogallos. Soon the modified, or hybrid Rogallo, appeared. These gliders had higher nose angles and longer wingspans. As before, steel wires braced the whole structure to increase strength and improve performance. This version proved much safer than the standard Rogallos, which could be unstable in moderate winds and turbulence. On the early standards, the sails attached to the leading edges and keel tube only, leaving large areas of material loose. All was well if the pilot maintained stable forward flight. The swept leading edges created vortexes that billowed the sail into a stable concave shape. But in turbulence or during a stall, one or both sides of the wing could deflate and collapse, or 'luff,' causing the glider to drop out of control. With more pilots foot-launching off of high rough terrain, hang gliding injuries and fatalities rose, accelerating the transition to modified Rogallo designs."

Development of the aircraft began under the direction of chief engineer Edward H. Heinemann. Subsequent analysis of captured data on wartime German sweptwing research, combined with sweptwing studies by American scientist Robert T. Jones, caused Douglas and the Navy to modify the D-558 contract by deleting three of the planned aircraft and replacing them with three sweptwing vehicles powered by both tu4bojet and rocket engines. The first three aircraft, each powered by a single General Electric TG-180 turbojet, became known as the D-558-1 Skystreak series.

The more powerful D558-2, using its 6,000-pound-thrust rocket engine fueled with liquid oxygen and diluted ethyl alcohol, could easily exceed Mach 1. The safety hazards of operating a heavily loaded rocket-propelled airplane from the ground later caused Douglas to modify the D-558-2 #2 and #3 for air launching from the bomb bay of a converted Boeing P2B-1S (Navy B-29) Superfortress. At the same time, Douglas modified the D-558-2 #2 to all-rocket propulsion, utilizing the space formerly taken up by its turbojet engine for additional rocket fuel. Thus modified, the D-558-2 #2 was capable of reaching Mach 2, which it did while being flown in a special high-speed flight"

Langley's simple approach was merely to scale up the unpiloted Aerodromes of 1896 to human-carrying proportions. The construction details and distribution of stresses on the Aerodrome A, as the full-sized version was called, were based on the successful performance of a gasoline-powered model, one-fourth the size. This exact scale miniature, known as the Quarter-scale Aerodrome, made two flights of 46 m (150 ft) and 108 m (350 ft) on June 18, 1901, powered by a five-cylinder radial internal combustion gasoline engine of about 3.2 horsepower. Between 1901 and 1903, the engine was rebuilt to produce slightly more than three horsepower, after which a final flight of 308 m (1,000 ft) was made on August 8, 1903. Because the structural and control requirements for a full-sized, piloted airplane were very different, the satisfactory flights of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome masked its flaws as a design prototype for the Aerodrome A.

He believed his only real hope of securing the kind of funding necessary was from the federal government. The breakthrough came when Langley's friend and colleague, Charles D. Walcott, of the U.S. Geological Survey, offered to present the proposal to President McKinley. A panel was created to review Langley's work up to that time. The panel, which included Assistant Secretary of the Navy, Theodore Roosevelt, met at the Smithsonian in April 1898. After a week of deliberations, they approved a grant of $50,000 from the Board of Ordnance and Fortification for Langley to construct a full-sized aircraft. The outbreak of the Spanish-American War only five days earlier contributed to the panel's favorable and speedy decision."

This exact scale miniature, known as the Quarter-scale Aerodrome, made two flights of 46 m (150 ft) and 108 m (350 ft) on June 18, 1901, powered by a five-cylinder radial internal combustion gasoline engine of about 1.5 horsepower designed and built by a New York inventor named Stephen M. Balzer. A native of Hungary, Balzer had constructed the first automobile in New York City in 1894. Between 1901 and 1903, the engine was rebuilt to produce slightly more than three horsepower, after which a final flight of 308 m (1,000 ft) was made on August 8, 1903. Because the structural and control requirements for a full-sized, piloted airplane were very different, the satisfactory flights of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome masked its flaws as a design prototype for the Aerodrome A. When in 1903 Langley twice attempted to fly the scaled-up, full-sized, piloted version of the Quarter-scale Aerodrome, i.e., the Aerodrome A, he met with disastrous results, thus ending his aeronautical experiments entirely."

Two liquid-cooled engines each developing about 1,750 hp powered the Do 335. Dornier mounted one engine in the nose and the other in the tail in a unique low-drag push-pull configuration. This innovative design also featured an ejection seat, a tail fin which the pilot could jettison, and tricycle landing gear. For a fighter airplane, the Do 335 was enormous: tall enough that a person of normal height could walk beneath it and very heavy at 9,600 kg (21,000 lb) loaded. Serious flaws also plagued the design. The rear engine overheated often and the landing gear was weak and prone to failure."

By 1942, the Luftwaffe needed multi-role fighters and after submitting a proposal in January 1943 for a Schnellbomber (fast bomber), Dornier built a prototype Do 335 V-1 (‘V’ for Versuchs or experimental) and the aircraft completed its first flight in September 1943. Following initial testing, the RLM ordered 14 prototypes, ten preproduction aircraft with the suffix designation A-0, eleven production A-1 single-seat aircraft, and 3 A-10 and A-12 two-seat trainers."

Unlike conventional twin-engine aircraft with wing-mounted engines, the Do 335 would not yaw sharply to one side if one engine failed, and single-engine flying speed remained respectable at about 620 km/h (345 mph). Pilots reported exceptional flight performance in acceleration and turning radius, and docile handling with no dangerous spin characteristics. In an emergency, however, the pilot could detonate explosive bolts and jettison the pusher three-blade propeller and dorsal fin to increase the chances of successfully bailing out using the pneumatic ejection seat. When fired, the seat pushed the pilot away from the aircraft with a force of about 20 Gs."

Burt Rutan (Rutan VariEze and Voyager, see NASM collection) assisted Jewett and Sheehan in the design work and the first Quickie was finished, tested in flight, and ready for a public introduction by April 1978. In June, the two men formed the Quickie Aircraft Corporation to produce and sell complete kits to build the aircraft. They flew the airplane to the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual gathering at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, in June where the Quickie drew intense public interest and won the Outstanding New Design award. By 1980, the firm had sold 350 kits."

There is a small tab on the left aileron for roll and one on the rudder for yaw. The incidence angle of the horizontal stabilizer is changed for pitch trim control. The aircraft has spoilers for speed control on the upper surface of each wing panel forward of the flaps. These are actuated by hydraulic pressure, as is the fully retractable landing gear and multiple disc brakes on the dual mail wheels. As a matter of aerodynamic design, the fuselage narrows at each side as the wing and engine nacelles extend outward.

Navy was deploying increasing numbers of anti-submarine assets to protect the eastern seaboard, once a fertile hunting ground for prowling U-boats. The submarine commanders moved their patrols far out to sea to avoid Allied air cover and roaming destroyers. High sea states in these open waters restricted visibility to several kilometers or less, and U-boat commanders were hard-pressed to acquire targets. The expanse of the open ocean also worsened the target detection problem. Near the coast, Allied ships traveled in relatively narrow areas. A U-boat could wait, just beneath the waves in daylight or float on the surface at night, and expect with some certainty that a target would steam within detection range. Away from the coast, U-boats had to patrol much larger areas and this reduced the chances of detecting Allied ships. German sonar and radar technology lagged behind Allied developments and also made detection of the U-boats easier."

Focke-Achgelis proposed a clever design best characterized by simplicity. The Fa 330 was simple to fabricate, easy to assemble on deck for flight, and weighed so little that two men could comfortably hoist the entire machine. The Fa 330 needed no engine because the submarine towed the gyro kite through the air. Like a gyro plane, the rotorkite flew by autorotation, meaning that the movement of relative wind through the rotors caused them to turn with sufficient speed to generate lift."

A control stick hung from the blade hub atop the mast. The pilot moved the stick for direct (no intervening control linkage) pitch and roll control, and he used foot pedals to move the large rudder and control yaw. The horizontal stabilizer had no moving control surfaces. Weight was saved on the rotor hub by using steel cables to support the blades against blade droop when the aircraft was not flying. The cables also limited the blades' range of movement when during flight. Instrumentation consisted of an altimeter, airspeed indicator, and tachometer.

The rotor blades consisted of a 3.2 m (10 ft 4 in) steel spar that supported plywood ribs. The blades were 0.3 m (12 in) wide and skinned with fabric-covered plywood.

One tube contained the blades and tail and the other contained the fuselage. Four crewmen could assemble the entire structure in three minutes in calm conditions. Rotation of the blades in preparation for flight could be done by hand, but if a course pitch (which provided the best operating performance) was preset on the rotor blades this became extremely difficult. In that case, a rope wrapped around drum on the rotor hub was used to get the rotor turning. The Fa 330 took off from a small platform attached to the aft railing of the U-boat's conning tower. A towline extended from an electric winch to a quick release coupling on the Fa 330. Since the primary duty of the Fa 330 was to spot suitable targets, communication with the towing vessel was essential. The pilot used an interphone system that consisted of a telephone cable, which paralleled the towline. Upon landing a rotor brake was provided to quickly stop the rotor spinning. Disassembly time was not much greater than that required for assembly. If the U-boat came under attack and had to make a crash dive the pilot could pull a quick release lever above the seat, and the towline would separate from the aircraft in addition to releasing the rotor hub from the mast. As the rotors departed they pulled a line out, which deployed a parachute. Once the parachute opened, the pilot released his seat buckle, which allowed the remainder of the aircraft structure to fall away. Additionally, the towline quick release coupling could be manually operated without engaging the rotor release."

A wind tunnel at Chalais-Meudon, France served as a simulator to train several crewmembers from each vessel that carried a Fa 330. Since very few of the prospective pilots had previous flight experience, and would have little opportunity to practice while on patrol, it was essential that the aircraft be easy to fly.

At that altitude, spotting distance was 53 kilometers (33 miles) in clear conditions. Like a kite, the maximum altitude attainable was dependent on airspeed. If the airspeed dropped to 50 km/h (31 mph), then the maximum altitude became 200 meters (656 ft) with a possible spotting distance of 50 kilometers (31 miles). If the speed dropped to the minimum safe towing speed of 35 km/h (22 mph) then the maximum altitude was only 100 meters (328 ft), with a possible spotting distance of 35 kilometers (22 miles)."

However, in the Indian Ocean, merchantmen still plied the seas without benefit of the convoy system and the Fa 330 could serve the U-boat service to some effect. The U-boat service began committing its longest-range vessels - the Type IX D2, known as the Monsoon boats, to operate with the Fa 330 in the Indian Ocean, frequently operating out of bases borrowed from the Japanese.

This is undoubtedly because of the extremely high loss rate among U-boats, which has meant that very few ships' logs have survived. There were several concerns that prevented wider employment of the Fa 330. A U-boat commander was faced with a choice between risking his entire vessel and crew to recover the pilot, or to crash dive the submarine and leave the unfortunate individual to suffer an almost certain death, in the event that the submarine had been spotted, in addition to the fact that it gave away the U-boats primary advantage - stealth. It appears that some U-boat commanders who were not enamored with the Fa 330 took the opportunity to trade them to the Japanese in exchange for floatplanes to patrol around U-boat bases in Java and Malaya. The Japanese Navy enjoyed more success with submarine launched aircraft. They had several classes of large submarines that could carry, launch and recover seaplanes capable of carrying reasonable weapon loads and which would not give away the submarine's position."

T2-4618 conducted a number of flight tests at Wright Field in 1946, during which it was equipped with a wheeled landing gear and towed by a truck. However the relatively large landing gear upset the center-of-gravity and made the aircraft difficult to takeoff and land. After four successful flights the aircraft rolled on landing and sustained some damage. The aircraft was repaired and sent to MacDill Air Force Base for further testing in 1948. There it was towed behind a boat, minus the wheeled undercarriage, for consideration as an aid for U.S. Air Force small rescue boats in spotting downed airmen in the water.

The first was the dramatic shift from so-called “manned” to Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS). This shift had occurred slowly over much of the twentieth century as cruise missiles, target drones, and autopilots narrowed the role of onboard human pilots. The MQ-1 and other RPAS consist of “air vehicles” and ground-control equipment connected to the air vehicle by radio and satellite data links. In most RPAS, including the Predator, humans are essential to their routine operation. While no one flies on the Predator, and it often cruises under control of an autopilot, most of its functions occur at the hands of a pilot, sensor operator, and mission intelligence coordinator in the ground-control station. In this way, the Predator is more “manned” than many other combat aircraft."

This encouraged development of new strategic doctrines that allowed persistent observation and aerial attack against individual targets with the same weapon system. Previously, the use of separate systems for aerial reconnaissance and for weapons delivery, often involving different military organizations, created operational and bureaucratic delays of hours, and often days, that allowed targets to escape attack or resulted in mistaken targeting. In military parlance, the Predator “closed the sensor-to-shooter cycle” (i.e., the time between the identification of the target and the strike) and “accelerated the kill chain.” The use of the Predator as an “aerial sniper” ushered in a new form of warfare with its own cultural and geopolitical implications."

Whereas airstrikes, cruise missile strikes, and special operations forces were the primary mode of American operations against terrorist organizations before 2001, they often engendered significant resistance and resentment in local populations and thus were not politically sustainable. Because Predators operated out of sight, were unmanned, and their missiles caused less unintended death and destruction than other means, the MQ-1 and its further development, the MQ-9 Reaper, operated with less political resistance than traditional forms of intervention."

Five years later, further development had resulted in a more advanced design, the Amber, with a superb loitering time due to its high-aspect-ratio sailplane-like wings.

The Air Force soon saw the Predator as an interim replacement for a shortfall in tactical reconnaissance aircraft with the added benefit of a live satellite video link. Authority for Predator development came under the 645th Aeronautical Systems Group, nicknamed “Big Safari,” which had responsibility for rapid development of reconnaissance systems outside conventional “mil-spec” airworthiness standards, resulting in a capable, but fragile, aircraft. In the late 1990s, Big Safari expanded the Predator’s capability to include a laser designator to illuminate targets and guide weapons dropped from other aircraft, reducing the sensor-to-shooter cycle. In 1999, this system had its first significant test during Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. One lesson learned was that the sensor-to-shooter cycle was still too great, as sometimes strike aircraft struggled to locate targets spotted by Predator. The solution was to explore options for arming the Predator with its own ordnance."

Given the requirement to make executive-level decisions about priority terrorist targets that might appear only briefly, the ability to watch Predator video and control the aircraft from the other side of the world in real time took on increased urgency. While Big Safari continued development in the United States, it also secretly operated several Predators from a base in Uzbekistan with the CIA during the summer and fall of 2000 to locate Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan. This paid off in September, with two and possibly three successful sightings, but President Clinton’s administration had not yet made a decision on direct military action against bin Laden, so the Predators soon returned to the United States. These operations also validated what would become the standard operational profile of the Predator in which a launch-and-recovery team at the operating airfield oversaw the takeoff and landing, but then passed control to a remote ground-control station via satellite, where a different crew managed the mission."

On this sortie, number 3034’s crew successfully located Taliban leader Mullah Omar’s convoy and maintained a firing position and requested clearance to engage. In an incident that has been highly debated ever since, authorization from the US Central Command was delayed and Omar entered a structure. Concerns about potential incidental causalities and damage led to a decision to strike a Taliban security vehicle nearby in a ploy to flush Omar out into the open. This was the first Hellfire strike from a Predator and the first successful operational use of a precision-guided UAV-delivered weapon, though other unmanned aircraft had been employed in offensive operations. During World War II, UAVs loaded with explosives were used as weapons by both the United States and Germany. The U.S. Navy employed the unmanned Interstate TDR-1 using freefall bombs against Japanese targets.

This could have been either Operation Southern Focus over Iraq or deployment to Djibouti in the Horn of Africa to support a CIA surveillance program over Yemen. Given this aircraft’s close association with the CIA/Big Safari program, and the timing of initial operations from Djibouti, the latter scenario is more likely. During its probable time there, a Predator Hellfire strike killed Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, who had masterminded the attack on the destroyer USS Cole.

Instead, with the ability to remain airborne for up to forty hours (though operational missions rarely go much beyond twenty hours), Predator pilots and sensor operators could understand the ground situation far more clearly than in any previous aerial platform. The Hellfire missile, while powerful, also has a narrow blast effect, which made possible precision strikes that were impossible from manned aircraft.

Another concern was the “soda straw” effect of viewing the world through the tight focus of the camera lens and thus missing important nearby activity.

Jamming poses a significant threat to the Predator’s data links and GPS navigation, so future systems require significant advances in artificial intelligence and inertial navigation as well as faster and stealthier airframes. Another challenge is cultural—who is a pilot? Initially, most RPAS pilots for the US Air Force were experienced combat pilots, but demand soon exceeded supply and the military services began training non-pilot operators. This has created organizational frictions in the military over who has the privileges of pilot status in a world where unmanned and autonomous operations are increasingly important. Regardless, the Predator and subsequent RPAS have dramatically changed the strategy and tactics of limited war in the twenty-first century."

Balsa wood, for lightness, formed the leading edge of the two-spar strut. The wooden-frame fuselage was covered with mahogany plywood panels around the cabin and tail area and with fabric on the aft fuselage and on the wings, struts, and flying tail surfaces.

The firm heeded the student's advice and increased the rib count from nine to eleven. The students also recommended adding a lower surface to the wing and closing the gap in the fabric at the wingroots. Personnel at Weedhopper installed a lower fabric surface that extended from the leading edge back to cover about three-quarters of the wing and they narrowed, but did not completely seal, the wingroot gap. The university team also suggested changing from a rounded wing trailing edge to a sharper profile but this modification would have made the aircraft too fast to comply with Federal Aviation Administration regulations that governed the maximum level flight speed of ultralight aircraft and the left the trailing edge remained unchanged."

        "content": "Weedhoppers cost less to purchase than other ultralights because the design was very simple. There was no gas gauge. The pilot estimated the fuel level by observing the liquid through the sides of the opaque gas tank. Nosewheel steering was manual and the pilot used his feet to push an aluminum tube that pivoted the wheel left or right. Chotia designed the wing without aileron control surfaces. He used only conventional flight controls (elevator and rudder) on the tail to guide the airplane. Fast aircraft not only cost more to design, they are more expensive to operate. Weedhopper pilots set no speed records as they cruised sedately above the earth at about 43-56 km/h (30-35 mph), but the exhilarating experience of flight also cost them no more than a few dollars. Keeping the Weedhopper simple and slow allowed Chotia to sell the aircraft as a kit, complete with engine, for $4,095 in 1982. In 2002, ultralight pilots could purchase an improved Weedhopper model 40 kit, complete with a Rotax 447 engine, for $7,995. Low purchase and operating costs helped Chotia's original company, Weedhopper of Utah Inc., sell more than 3,000 Weedhopper B models, plus another 2,500 C models. After 1983, Nova-Air and Weedhopper Inc. sold between 3,000 and 4,000 additional JC-24 ultralights. By 2002, dealers had sold nearly 15,000 Weedhoppers world wide."

Poorly-written instructions and careless manufacture of several parts caused long delays in completing the aircraft. They flew the ultralight airplane for 20 hours before donating it to the Smithsonian Institution. Those hours were full of adventure. Before one test flight, carbon monoxide poisoned the pilot just minutes before takeoff. Another flight ended in a crash that injured no one but substantially damaged the airplane."

The aircraft would be demonstrated by the manufacturers, and would be tested by front-line combat pilots. The design with the best overall performance would be awarded a production contract. Thirty-one airplanes from ten manufacturers were evaluated for such qualities as speed, maneuverability, diving ability, pilot's view, climbing rate, performance at high altitude, etc. One rotary-engined and one in-line-engined design were selected."

Because the hoped-for higher horsepower rotary engines intended for use in the Fokker D.VI were not available soon enough, the airplane had to be fitted with an older, lower-horsepower engine, which rendered performance below combat standards.

The V.11 was largely the creation of Fokker's chief designer, Reinhold Platz. Platz was the true creative force behind the famous Fokker fighters of the second half of the war. He did most of the fundamental design work on the firm's aircraft after 1916. Anthony Fokker's talents were greater as a test pilot than as a designer. He had an innate ability to fly an experimental aircraft and know just what improvements needed to be made to turn it into a successful performer. This intuitive sense on the part of Fokker, combined with Platz's innovative preliminary designs, made them a formidable team. Fokker's ego and dominating personality frequently led him to understate Platz's role as the genuine innovator of the designs that bore the Fokker name, and he took undue credit for himself. Nevertheless, there is no denying the important contributions Fokker made to bringing Platz's designs to final form. This was especially true in the case of the Fokker D.VII."

On January 23, famed German ace, Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron, flew the V.11 at Fokker's request. Richthofen thought the airplane was maneuverable and had generally good performance, but that it was tricky to handle and directionally unstable, especially in a dive. Ritchhofen's assessment confirmed Fokker's own impression of the V.11 from his brief testing of the airplane before the competition began. To remedy these problems, Fokker lengthened the fuselage 40 cm (16 in), added a fixed vertical fin and a new rudder shape, and altered the aileron balances, among other small changes. With these modifications, the V.11 was safe and pleasant to fly, and had lost little of the maneuverability that had initially impressed von Richthofen. The Red Baron flew the improved V.11 and now found the airplane delightful to handle. He urged other pilots at the competition to try it, and they also thought the design was very promising. Given his stature, the endorsement of von Richthofen went far towards the selection of the V.11 as the winner of the competition."

Moreover, Fokker understood better than any of his competitors that overall performance was more important in a fighter aircraft than exceptional performance in one or two areas, such as speed or climb rate. Other aircraft at Adlershof were better than the V.11 in individual performance parameters.

Concerned that the Fokker factory would be unable to meet the demand for the new fighter, IdFlieg (Inspektion der fliegertruppen), directed Albatros, (Fokker's great rival) to produce D.VIIs under license. Albatros built the Fokker D.VII at both its Johannisthal and Schneidemühl factories, known as Albatros-Werke G.m.b.H. and Osdeutsche Albatros Werke respectively. The Johannisthal-built aircraft carried the designation Fokker D.VII (Alb) and those constructed at Schneidemühl were identified Fokker D.VII (O.A.W.). Because the Fokker factory produced no construction drawings, working only from jigs and assembly sketches, Albatros had to make its own drawings, based on a completed airframe obtained from Fokker. This, in addition to each firm applying its own construction techniques and standards, resulted in Fokker D.VIIs that looked alike, but differed in detail. Thus, not all components were interchangeable on airplanes built at the three factories. Moreover, the aircraft built by Albatros were generally considered to be of higher quality than those produced by the primary contractor, Fokker. Interestingly, more Fokker D.VIIs were produced by Albatros than by Fokker, with a total for all three factories of approximately 1,000 aircraft."

The airplane was then experimentally fitted with the new 185-horsepower B.M.W. IIIa, which dramatically improved performance. Unfortunately, only limited quantities of the B.M.W. IIIa were available.

The Fokker D.VII's thick wing section endowed the airplane with good stall characteristics. Positioning below and behind a two-seater, where the enemy observer could not bring his guns to bear, a D.VII pilot could safely put his airplane into a nose-high attitude, with full power, in a nearly stalled condition.

His approach would get more pilots flying more frequently and perhaps bring in new blood to the small community of soaring pilots at a time when the movement was trying to survive the depths of the Depression. Thus was born the Bowlus BA-100 Baby Albatross, named because the dimensions and layout of the wing resemble that of the Grunau Baby designed in Germany, and because Hawley's astute business sense told him that a 'Baby' version of his Senior Albatross had valuable built-in name recognition."

The designer must have considered the special needs of amateur builders from the beginning. By adopting a simple and inexpensive aluminum tube to connect the cockpit pod and the empennage, he saved the builder considerable time fabricating and assembling a more conventional fuselage built up from many wooden or metal parts. Bowlus designed the wooden pod that enclosed and streamlined the cockpit in such a way that he and several crafts persons could prepare the parts and mail them to builders for final assembly."

Years later, Mitchell designed an interesting series of all-wing ultralights including the Mitchell U-2 Superwing (see NASM collection). Bowlus and Mitchell stated working early in February 1937 and completed the aircraft one year later. While Mitchell worked almost around-the-clock for several months, Bowlus could spare only nights and weekends as he struggled to support his wife, Ruth, and their four children. The first prototype differs from the later versions in some important ways: Bowlus used cables for aileron control rather than heavier, but more precise, push rods. He also skinned the ailerons with plywood but chose not to rig them to move differentially to minimize adverse yaw. The elevators are the same type fitted to the Senior Albatross. According to one account, the first prototype Baby Albatross, registered NX18979, is fitted with the aluminum nose cap from the Senior Albatross number 3, registered G13780."

Bowlus left easily fabricated parts such as the canopy and windshield for builders to design and form, based on the type of flying they planned to do. The designer did not equip the Baby with spoilers to improve glide path control but a number of owners installed them later.

The scarf joint refers to the careful and time-consuming method of shaping the plywood edges to meet at precise angles with no gaps. Wood workers had to shape each piece differently to fit the continuously curved surface of the pod. Precision was important to give the weak casein glue as much surface as possible with to bond. To manufacturer pods for the kits, Bowlus abandoned the laborious scarf-jointed pod and adopted a technique similar to that used by Lockheed to build fuselages for the Vega, Orion, and Altair monoplanes flown by Wiley Post, Amelia Earhart, Roscoe Turner, Charles Lindbergh, and other record-setting flyers during the 1920s and 1930s. Crafts persons layered .07 cm (1/32 inch) mahogany and poplar plywood veneer into a wooden mold with glue sandwiched between the layers. They then placed an inflatable bag over the wet layers, and lowered a concrete male mold down into the wooden mold and bolted it securely a few inches above the bag. The crafts persons inflated the bag so that it evenly applied about (10 lb/in²) to the whole inside of the pod skin, and set aside the mold aside to dry. After waiting several days, they removed the finished halves, trimmed and dressed them, and glued and nailed the shells to the internal framework. A molded pod sped construction because it required only six frames versus eleven for the scarf-jointed pods used for the prototypes."

        "content": "The cockpit was too narrow to accommodate a conventional, three-axis, control stick. To permit the pilot to roll the sailplane, Bowlus copied the arrangement he had used in the Senior Albatross and mounted a smart-looking 'butterfly' wheel on top of a stick. By pushing a set of conventional rudder pedals, the pilot controlled yaw, and a simple panel presented the essential instruments: altitude, airspeed, and compass. A competent pilot could fly the Baby Albatross at a maximum lift-to-drag ratio of 19:1 at 56 km/h (35 mph). Bowlus set the never-exceed speed, at 100 km/h (62 mph). The Baby Albatross was capable of doing well in soaring contests in the hands of experienced pilots. Unfortunately, the design of the elevator control made the aircraft sensitive about the pitch axis, something that new pilots had to approach with great care. Operating the aircraft for several years revealed that that neither the streamlined wooden shell around the cockpit, nor the aluminum castings used for fittings in areas subjected to high stress, were durable enough. Despite these shortcomings, the design became the most successful aircraft that Bowlus developed. Such respected names in the aviation industry as Jack Frye, president of Transcontinental & Western Airlines, Rubin Fleet at Consolidated Aircraft, engine builder Al Menasco, Glenn L. Martin, Jack Northrop, and Donald Douglas backed the production of the kits and kept the cost down to less than one-third the price of a Senior Albatross. Hawley Bowlus might have sold many hundreds had World War II not intervened."

Among the group were pilots who accomplished significant flights at the controls of their Baby Albatrosses. Eastern Airlines Captain J. Shelly Charles of Atlanta made a number of impressive flights. He flew 423 km (263 miles) on one occasion and later soared to an altitude of more than 3,040 m (10,000 ft). On 6 June 1939, Woody Brown flew his Baby Albatross, \"Thunder Bird,\" a distance of 451 km (280 miles) from Wichita Falls, Texas, to Wichita, Kansas, a U. S. National record for distance flown to a declared goal. Dick Johnson's first win at the U. S. nationals came in 1940 at the controls of a Baby Albatross. According to Bowlus records, Florence \"Pancho Barnes\" Lowe, bought serial number 118 and kit units 1, 2, 3, and 4 were shipped to her by 15 December 1939, but no further information is known.

Pitts began with an idea for an aerobatic aircraft that would defy gravity and be crisp on the controls. Rather than the larger pre-war biplanes, Pitts wanted something smaller that would climb, roll, and change attitude much more quickly. Instead of a large radial engine, Pitts built his aircraft around the new smaller and lighter horizontally-opposed engines. The swept wing allowed for access and center of gravity (CG) factors and made snap rolls snap more sharply. The resulting Pitts Special S-1 was revolutionary because of its small size, light weight, short wingspan, and extreme agility. The prototype S-1 was wrecked several years after its first flight."

The Huff-Daland Manufacturing Company of Ogdensburg, New York modified its Petrel 5 military/commercial biplane into a practical duster with a chemical tank and spreader system and formed the Huff-Daland Duster Company in Louisiana. C.E. Woolman soon took over the faltering company and with entomologist Dr. Bert Coad built a pioneering insect and chemical research and aerial delivery business throughout the country. Woolman also expanded the business to include passenger and freight carrying and renamed it Delta Air Service, which became Delta Airlines. With the deep Depression years of the 1930s and then World War II, further development of crop duster airplanes was shelved until after the war. Delta Airlines later restored one of the only two remaining original Huff-Daland Dusters and donated it to the Smithsonian's National Air Museum in 1968; it now hangs at the Steven F.

The Stearman was a good airplane; however, it and other civil aircraft such as the DC-6 and Antonov AN-2M were never designed for sustained flying in this type of environment. Crop dusting is flying swaths of fields at extremely low altitude (8-10 feet), performing procedural turns at low altitude, and climbing and diving expediently for position and to avoid wires and trees. The field of flight must be exact to ensure precise, even application and contain drift of the load only onto the field and not onto homes or roads. Power management, maneuverability, and changing weight and balance combined with wind drift and specific application characteristics of the load add to the ever-changing equation for the pilot.

The pilots were delighted with its handling qualities and its low stall speed of 67 mph as stalling an aircraft, i.e. loss of lift, while entering a turn at low speed and low altitude was a major crop duster pitfall. Pilots were also impressed with the cockpit that offered good visibility and was designed to withstand a 40 g impact. One of the pilots, Dick Reade, suggested the name \"Ag-Cat\" in keeping with Grumman's practice of using the word \"cat\" in its military aircraft nomenclature, i.e. Hellcat; Reade's name is painted on this NASM aircraft."

The first Schweizer-built Ag-Cat flew in 1959. The Ag-Cat is a single-seat, strut-braced biplane with a 35 percent wing stagger which provides the excellent low speed wing stall characteristics that are necessary for low altitude maneuvers. The fuselage is constructed of a welded steel tubing truss which is covered with removable aluminum panels to facilitate post flight cleaning.

Schweizer purchased the certificate from Gulfstream (formerly Grumman) and, beginning in 1981, introduced subsequent models with engine options and longer wings and fuselages to accommodate larger hoppers and their payloads: the Super-B 600, Super-B PT6 turbine, and the PT6A Turbo Ag-Cat D with a 500 gallon hopper. Ag-Cat Corp bought the certificate in 1995 and built about 5 aircraft; then Allied Ag-Cat purchased the design but did not build any aircraft. Ethiopia Air Lines built 15 Super-B turbines in the 1990s Many radial and turbine conversions continue to power this rugged aircraft and have substantially lengthened the life of this great design."

The first test and acceptance flight was conducted on May 6, 1963 and at the time of manufacture it was equipped with a 300 hp Jacobs R-755A2M1 engine and a Sensenich propeller. In late May 1963, the airplane was ferried to a company leasing operation in Oxnard, California. In late 1963, the wings were covered with .040 sheet aluminum. It was registered to Shell Aviation on April 11, 1974 and in November 1974 the airplane was upgraded to Super Ag-Cat standards with the installation of a 300 gallon cargo hopper and a 600 horse power Pratt & Whitney R-1340 engine. Moe's Crop Dusting Service purchased the airplane in 1975 and installed special booster wing tips on all four wing panels. HBR Aviation Leasing purchased the plane in the late 1970's. On May 1, 1982, the airplane was involved in a ground accident when it struck a ground trailer. HBR installed a locking tail wheel in 1985 and, in March 1987, replaced the metal covered wings with fabric covered ones and installed under wing spray booms as well as a speed ring cowling on the R-1340 radial engine. Ralph Holsclaw of Growers Air Service in Woodland, California, purchased the Ag-Cat from HBR Aviation Leasing on November 29, 1993."

By the time Royal Air Force (RAF) Spitfires could launch, climb out, and then try to intercept these raids, the bombers crews had usually dropped their loads and turned for home. An aircraft was needed to patrol the skies over England for up to seven hours during the night, and then follow radar vectors to attack German aircraft before they reached their target.

As a result, several hundred P-61s did not have this turret. Those that did experienced buffeting when the turret was traversed from side to side and a fix took time. By October 1943, the first P-61s were coming off the line. Training started immediately, and the first night fighters arrived in the European Theater by March 1944.

It was a Nakajima Ki-44 Shoki (Demon) TOJO and the fighters maneuvered wildly as they attempted to gain an advantage. The P-61 crew lost and reacquired the Ki-44 several times then finally lost it for good and returned to base. The next day ground troops found the wrecked TOJO.

Beech Aircraft Corporation developed the King Air in 1964 as a compromise between piston-engine and jet aircraft and the design quickly found success. The King Air can fly farther and higher than piston-engine aircraft, and, unlike many jets, it can land on the short runways of most small airports. With the three different models, including the C90B, still in production in 2001, this aircraft remains the primary business aircraft for small to mid-size companies, and it is an integral part of the flight inventories of many larger corporations."

After Walter Beech's death in 1950, his wife and co-founder, Olive Ann, became president and chairman of Beech, and she continued the profitable aircraft production lines while also diversifying into other aerospace endeavors. In 1959, Beech Aircraft introduced the Model 65 Queen Air to fill the gap between the six-seat twin-Bonanza, a derivative of the single-engine Bonanza introduced in 1947, and the Super 18, a deluxe version of the classic Beech 18. The Queen Air featured the low-wing, all-metal, tricycle design typical of Beech's post-war aircraft, carried seven to nine passengers, and featured two horizontally-opposed 340-hp Lycoming engines. Subsequent improvements included a swept tail and a pressurized fuselage, but when turboprop engines were added to a Queen Air 88 in 1964, it was re-designated the King Air 90."

To improve its utility and safety in changing flight conditions, standard equipment, that had been optional on the Queen Air, included de-icing boots on the leading edges of the wings, fin, and tailplane. Flight instruments allowed for all-weather capabilities and various communications and navigation packages included autopilot, radio, and radar systems. The Model 90 had two seats in the cockpit and four reclining passenger seats facing each other in the cabin, with options for a two or three-place couch for passengers. Air conditioning and soundproofing also improved passenger comfort in the cabin. Two 500-hp P&W Canada PT6A-6 turboprop engines with three-blade Hartzell propellers gave the King Air a top ceiling of 27,400 feet and a range of 1,565 miles at 270 mph. Piston-powered aircraft could not match this performance while emerging jet aircraft of the 1960s used turbojet engines that were high-priced, noisy, and had high fuel consumption."

After the King Air's initial success, Beech concentrated on continuous upgrades to appeal to a range of executive and corporate needs. Sophisticated electronics packages, increased cabin space, and finer interior amenities in Models 90, 100, 200, 300, and 350 provided comfortable working and transport environments for business travelers. Newer models are longer and sport T-tails, but the basic configuration remains the same and continues to appeal as a new or previously owned medium-range aircraft. In addition to the airframe, the Pratt & Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine family consistently provides a high level of performance and reliability. Nearly 40 years since its introduction, the King Air series is still the king of the turboprops and fills a significant niche in the business aviation marketplace."

One hundred and twelve of these models were built. The aircraft received its airworthiness certificate on April 16, 1965 and was registered as N1920H. The exterior was white with Morning Glory Blue and Jubilee Gold trim and the interior was Frontier Green, Black and Arctic Beige. On April 23, 1965, the Aviation Department of Helmerich and Payne, Inc., of Tulsa, Oklahoma, purchased the aircraft and the company flew the aircraft almost every other day for many years, mostly around the Central Plains states. The aircraft's registration changed to N10LE on October 8, 1973 and it flew in California, until May 20, 1976, when the registration was changed to N275DP. I FLY SOUTH of Wilmington, Delaware, owned the aircraft by 1994 and it then returned to Raytheon's Beech Aircraft Corporation in March 1998. Stevens Aviation, of Vandalia, Ohio, performed general maintenance and painted it white with red and gray trim before Raytheon flew it to National Airport near Washington, DC, in April 1998. There, its flight career ended with 7,164.5 hours on the airframe. It was disassembled and trucked across the Potomac River to the Museum for installation in the Business Wings exhibit. In July of 2000, when the exhibit closed, Raytheon donated the aircraft to the Museum."

A fixed, water-cooled engine, capable of generating at least 150 horsepower, was in his view the power plant of the future. At this time, just such an engine was undergoing trials. It was a new Hispano-Suiza V-8, designed by that company's founder and chief designer, a Swiss-born engineer named Marc Birkigt. The engine was a great step forward in that it had a much better power-to-weight ratio than previous water-cooled designs, as well as many other modern features. The new Hispano-Suiza engine was just what Béchereau was calling for. He designed his next airframe around the advanced Hispano-Suiza motor; the result was the famous Spad VII.

It performed well, and someone reasonably handy with average shop tools could construct one in their own garage. The design had much going for it, but like so many homebuilt aircraft before and since, a few key engineering lapses in the design, plus problems with the engine and propeller, relegated the Moni to the category of homebuilt aircraft that promise much in design but fail to deliver. Harold C. Weston generously donated his Moni to the National Air and Space Museum in April 1992. Weston built the airplane himself and flew it more than 40 hours."

Airframe weight totaled about 118 kg (260 lb), a mere 1.8 kg (4 lb) above the legal weight limit for ultralights but the Moni was at least two times faster. This performance depended on a small and economical power plant, the KFM (Komet Flight Motors) 107 two-stroke air-cooled engine that Monnett included with all the kits he sold. This engine was not as reliable as many pilots hoped and several propeller failures occurred, too. Good performance also depended on a sound airframe but glue held the wings together in the early kits. After several wings failed in flight, Monnett redesigned the wings for riveted construction. Some builder/pilots were enthusiastic about the performance. One pilot said, \"I think that the Moni is a joy to fly. I have flown throughout Oklahoma, into Texas and Kansas. I took one cross-country that was 700 statute miles [1,127 km] round trip. The Moni does what it was designed to do very well. It is a good day VFR recreational aircraft.\" Harold C.

Following the production of this aircraft through 1929, the Navy requirement for a new primary flight traininer for the 1930s prompted the development of an important series of biplanes that served from 1938 through World War II. The N3N model, manufactured by the Navy Aircraft Factory (NAF) in Philadelphia answered the need. The N3N was used extensively as the primary trainer until the end of WWII. Outwardly, this aircraft appeared similar to the Consolidated NY-2 and NY-3. The major difference in the N3N was its structure, which featured riveted extruded aluminum fuselage construction with removable side panels for ease of inspection and maintenance.

Their desire to have a better airplane resulted in the formation of the Kreider-Reisner Aircraft Company, in 1926, and the development of the Challenger series of three-place, open-cockpit biplanes starting with the C-1 and culminating with the C-4C. The principal differences between the various airplanes of the Challenger C series were the engines used in them. The C-1 and C-2 had 90 hp inline Curtiss OX-5 engines. The C-3 had a 110 hp 7-cylinder Warner Scarab radial, the C-4A had a 130 hp 7-cylinder Comet radial and the C-4C had a 165 hp, 5 cylinder Wright J-6 radial. As the series progressed there were other refinements such as split axle landing gear, and better aileron balance."

Mrs. Keith Miller, a noted woman pilot of the era, entered one in the 1929 National Air Tour and placed 8th in a heavily competitive field of entries. Another C-4C/KR-34C was used as the official press plane for the Air Tour. The C-4C was popular as an air taxi and as a sport aircraft, too. The recently expanded plant in Hagerstown produced a number of the C-4Cs before sales were severely curtailed by the stock market crash in late 1929. To sell off the existing inventory, the company resorted to various sales ploys and modifications such as seaplane conversions and adding guns for military applications. Approximately 60 examples of this versatile airplane were built."

The biplane configuration was a wire braced single bay arrangement in which the top wing was attached to the fuselage with four vertical center section struts. The fuselage mounted lower wing was heavily staggered and was connected to the top wing with outboard \"N\" type interplane struts. The ailerons were located on the top wing. The available engine options were either the 50 hp Anzani radial or the 60 hp Le Rhone radial. The conventional main landing gear had the main wheels displaced forward of the normal axle center and had shock absorbing wooden skids placed aft of the main axle location. The purpose of this arrangement was to prevent nose-overs and to also provide a measure of braking during landings. These skids were an advantage for the skilled pilots during precision landing competitions in the days before brakes were installed on airplanes."

Unfortunately, the selling price for the Sport was $4,850, a fairly hefty price for that era. While the supply of war surplus Standards and Curtiss Jennies was well past its peak by that time, they were still likely to be considerably lower in price than the asking price for the Farman Sport. In terms of performance, by 1926, Ludington was flying the Waco 9 in races instead of the Farman. Lack of Farman sales did not faze Ludington too badly however, because his real intent was to get involved in the emerging airline business. The Exhibition Company became Ludington Philadelphia Flying Service, Inc. and in 1929, Ludington Line airline service before it was sold to Eastern Air Transport."

Small, one-man helicopters were seen as a possible alternative to large, piston powered helicopters that seemed to be at the limit of their development. The military's greatest technical hurdle was to develop an aircraft that was relatively safe and could easily be flown by a combat infantryman. Stanley Hiller, founder and president of Hiller Helicopters, had built a successful business, founded on innovative approaches to helicopter design, and was more than willing to undertake the challenge. Although the flying platforms that resulted from the company's efforts proved to be an aerodynamic dead end, Hiller did demonstrate the practicality of the ducted fan for more conventional forms of Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) aircraft."

He hypothesized that if a small horizontal platform, with a person balancing on top as on a bicycle, was lifted upward by a vertical thrust vector, then the pilot's innate kinesthetic responses would stabilize the platform and also allow it to be controlled in pitch in roll. Although the high center of gravity of such a configuration would seem to result in severe instability, Zimmerman's theory proved correct. If the platform began to tilt in one direction, then the pilot would naturally lean in the other direction to remain upright. This natural balancing tendency would place the center of gravity above the thrust axis, which would result in an upward pitching moment that counteracted the toppling action, thus maintaining a stable condition. The pilot could control the aircraft simply by leaning in the desired direction and the platform would begin to tilt and gain forward momentum. As the aircraft was controlled by instinct, a person could fly it with minimal training, making it ideal for use by soldiers in the field."

Control for the contraption, nicknamed the \"Flying Shoes,\" was accomplished entirely by weight shifting against the pole. The Flying Shoes suffered instability problems because the engines provided unequal thrust. Stanley Hiller heard about this experiment and was greatly intrigued. In 1948, Zimmerman made a deal that allowed Hiller Helicopters to continue development, while he returned to his old aeronautical engineering position at the NACA (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics, forerunner of NASA) laboratory in Langley, Virginia."

The first of these efforts used compressed air channeled through attached fire hoses for thrust, while the second, known as the Whirligig (see NASM collection), used a compressed air-driven propeller on the underside of a lightweight platform to generate thrust. These developments proved to be extremely easy to fly and were stable in flight, although the larger and heavier Whirligig proved to be less stable and more difficult to control than its predecessor."

This arrangement was stable and performed well, but any concept that forced the pilot to stand on the airborne equivalent of a food processor with nothing to prevent inadvertent contact with the rotors was unlikely to generate much enthusiasm. Hiller's engineers went back to Zimmerman's original patent application for his Flying Shoes, in which the rotors were to have been located in what he termed as \"venturi rings.\" These consisted of airfoil profiles formed into a circle. The venturi ring would soon become known as a ducted fan. The ducted fan's airfoil accelerated the airflow into the rotors, increasing thrust to a level approximately 40 percent greater than an unducted propeller of the same diameter. Hiller's solved the Flying Shoes' problem of asymmetric thrust by mounting the counter-rotating propellers co-axially. The Model 1031 used two engines, each directly driving one of the rotors inside the 1.52 m (5 ft) diameter duct."

Initial flights were made by Hiller's chief test pilot, Philip T. Johnston. Because there was little to protect the pilot in the event of an engine failure or loss of control, he was tethered to a high wire suspended between two towers. The Model 1031 proved relatively stable, and easy to handle when hovering. A natural self-correcting tendency in forward flight was noted. This occurred because the forward lip of the duct would generate more lift than the trailing edge causing an upward pitching moment. Unfortunately, while this made the platform almost impossible to topple, it also limited the forward speed to a mere 26 kph (16 mph), and resulted in erratic handling in windy conditions."

This improved design used the same components as the original platform and was designated as the Model 1031-A. On the Model 1031, differential braking on the rotors had controlled yaw, but with the combined transmission, this was no longer an option, so a pair of movable vanes was placed in the ducted fan's inflow to provide a new mechanism for yaw control."

        "label": "Long Description",
        "content": "The Model 1031-A could not operate out of ground effect because of its limited thrust. Hiller engineers determined that loading on the fixed-pitch rotors' was too high and that the only solution was to use longer rotor blades, which necessitated construction of a larger platform, designated the Model 1031-A-1. By this time, the Department of the Army, dissatisfied with De Lackner's progress, had begun to take over control of Hiller's Navy contract. The new platform, with 2.13 m (7 ft) diameter rotors, which first flew on November 20, 1957, was able to operate successfully out of ground effect, but a new problem was encountered. The increased weight of the platform lowered the center of gravity to the level that kinesthetic control was greatly impaired. Hiller engineers attempted to correct this by raising the pilot's platform. However, controllability was still a problem since the total weight of the platform had increased to the stage where weight shift alone could not insure an adequate level of stability or control. The solution to this was the addition of a gyro-stabilization system that used aerodynamic servos similar to those that Hiller had used on the UH-12. The new system, which was linked to four control vanes in the outflow, improved stability in the hover significantly. The most dramatic illustration of the new system occurred when an Army sniper was able to aim and fire his rifle while hovering in free flight, without any thought to aircraft control. However, in forward flight in anything but the calmest conditions, the platform experienced erratic oscillations that the gyrostabilizer could not dampen out. Various duct configurations were tried, but those that showed the greatest increase in stability also produced the least amount of thrust."

However the Army insisted that the new platforms, designated VZ-1E, should include a third engine as a backup in case of a failure of either of the two main engines. This requirement necessitated construction of a larger platform, with 2.44 m (8 ft) diameter rotors. The extra weight of the additional engine and larger airframe further increased the control difficulties to the point that kinesthetic control was no longer practical. Hiller attempted to remedy the situation by lengthening the ducted fan for greater stability and developing a more conventional control system in which a seated pilot would maintain control with a stick linked to the control vanes that had originally been intended only for yaw. This latest development proved to have a faster forward flight speed than the Model 1031, but did not resolve the control or instability problems. However, the modified VZ-1E did lead to a new line of thinking."

Thus, the Office of Naval Research funded the development of a prototype coleopter, or ring-wing VTOL aircraft, consisting of a lengthened ducted fan, which was intended to act as a lifting fuselage when the aircraft pivoted from a vertical to horizontal attitude for high-speed forward flight. A mockup of the coleopter, designated the VXT-8, was constructed, but the design went no further. Control of the coleopter in forward flight would have been extremely difficult. Hiller's final attempt to exploit the merits of the ducted fan was a proposal for an Army \"flying jeep\" competition. The Hiller design, which was not accepted, consisted of four ducted fans powered by a gas turbine attached to a simple frame. Considering Hiller's experience with ducted fans on the Model 1031, the design may well have revolutionized battlefield transportation if a suitable control system had been developed. By this time, however, turbine helicopters such as Bell's new HU-1 Huey, were overcoming many of the hurdles faced by the piston-engine models, and the flying jeep was abandoned."

In spite of its ultimate failure, the flying platform program proved to be a public relations bonanza for Hiller. When photos of the Flying Platform appeared in the media, the public was immediately captivated, perhaps because the platform's lack of visible propulsion seemed to be inspired from the flying saucer frenzy then sweeping the nation. While the apparent successes of the flying platform were widely reported, its inherent aerodynamic flaws were not publicized. Thus, many enthusiasts, even decades later, felt that a viable mode of transport had been unjustly abandoned. As a result, ducted fan platforms have occasionally appeared in the backyards of amateur inventors, who are unaware of the Model 1031's potentially fatal problems. However, the Hiller Flying Platform's vivid demonstrations of the potential of ducted fan technology may yet result in the inspiration for other new approaches to vertical flight."

It was the single-seat version of the Bü-131A Jungmann, a two-place advanced aerobatic sport and training plane introduced in 1934 by Bücker Flugzeugbau in Berlin. The Jungmann became popular with the flying schools of Luftsportverband, a civil flying association during the early 1930s before military flight was allowed in Germany. In reality, the association trained the pilots who formed a clandestine air arm that later became the Luftwaffe. In 1935, Carl Bücker introduced the single seat Jungmeister, so similar to the Jungman that parts could be interchanged. While the Jungmeister was designed to use either the Hirth HM 506 160-hp inline air-cooled engine or the seven-cylinder radial air-cooled Siemens Sh-14A of 160 hp, the latter engine was used almost exclusively. The fuselage was a steel tube covered with fabric, and the wings were built of wooden spars and ribs with fabric cover, with the upper and lower panels being interchangeable. The outer wing panels had an 11-degree sweep-back."

Some pilots of the prewar era contend that the only aircraft that matched the Jungmeister were the specially built Great Lakes trainers, but others even question this comparison. A number of Jungmeisters still exist, both here and in Europe, and command high prices because of their scarcity and demonstrated maneuverability. After World War II, a limited number of the airplanes were produced near Munich, but high labor costs made them almost prohibitively expensive. This situation and the growing enthusiasm for aerobatic flying led to the development of rival types such as the Pitts Special, the Zlin 526A Trener Master, and the Yak 18 PS."

During the Cleveland Air Races of 1937, both Papana and Count Hagenburg flew the aircraft in competition after the latter's Jungmeister crashed while these two pilots were engaging in a showmanship contest. Papana made a low level inverted pass in front of the grandstands, and Hagenburg, not wishing to be outdone, repeated the maneuver at no more than a few feet above the ground. But as he pushed forward to climb out, the vertical fin hit the ground slowing him sufficiently to cause the plane to crash.

World War II fighters were some of the most powerful propeller-driven, piston-engine aircraft ever made, so they were ideal for the Unlimited Class, which dictated no restrictions to limit performance. Greenamyer and a team of fellow Lockheed Skunk Works employees used their engineering creativity to modify a Grumman F8F-2 Bearcat into a purpose-built air racer. Grumman designed the Bearcat late in World War II as a replacement for the F6F Hellcat Navy fighter. It was noted for its exceptional climbing ability and maneuverability. Conquest 1 featured a shorter wingspan than the production Bearcat, a special small bubble canopy, a larger propeller taken from a Douglas A-1 Skyraider, and a propeller spinner from a North American P-51H Mustang. Special high-octane gasoline, fuel additives, and putty-sealed gaps to reduce drag greatly increased its speed."

Lunar Orbiter 1 became the first spacecraft to take a picture of the Earth from the Moon, preempting the famous \"Earthrise\" photograph of Apollo 8 by more than two years. But this Lunar Orbiter image, for all of its significance did not have the salience of the more famous image in part because it was not full color. At the completion of the third mission, moreover, the Apollo planners announced that they had sufficient data to press on with an astronaut landing, and were able to use the last two missions for other activities. They conducted more general scientific surveys and also mapped the lunar gravitational field. For example, Lunar Orbiter 4 photographed the entire nearside and 95 percent of the farside, and Lunar Orbiter 5 completed the farside coverage and acquired up to two-meter resolution images of 36 pre-selected areas."

Having no suitable fighter design of its own, the United States adopted the Nieuport 28 as a stop-gap measure before the much-in-demand Spad XIIIs could be made available from the French. The Nieuport 28 performed creditably as the first operational pursuit aircraft in the fledgling U.S. Air Service of the American Expeditionary Force. Thus, the primary significance of the Nieuport 28 for the national aeronautical collection is that it was the first fighter aircraft to serve with an American fighter unit under American command and in support of U.S. troops.

The upper wings have a manufacturing date of February 1919 with serial numbers 7103 (left panel) and 7226 (right panel).

The fuselage serial number being higher than the lower wing numbers dates it as very late 1918 or very early 1919. The upper wings are dated 1919. Therefore, the NASM aircraft could not have been a war veteran. Further, given the late production dates, it can be concluded that the NASM aircraft must be a modified and improved postwar version of the Nieuport 28C.1, sometimes referred to as a Nieuport 28A."

The upper and lower wing sets could have been originally paired together as their respective numbers are relatively close together. But the 6400 series serial numbered wings and 7000 series numbered wings were unlikely to have been on the same airframe when the airplane first left the factory. Moreover, the NASM airplane, on at least one occasion, probably more, was put together from \"best available components\" from a collection of Nieuport 28 airframes. The most reasonable interpretation based on the evidence is that the NASM Nieuport 28 is not a documented single airframe with a continuous history. It is an amalgam of component parts of several aircraft brought together many years after their original individual manufacture."

The airplanes did not fly in the film, they were only run up and taxied. Some have argued that the NASM aircraft is one of these four. At best, this can only be said of the fuselage. Several famous photographs from the production show a line-up of the four Nieuports. All four Dawn Patrol Nieuports had their wings shortened by several feet. This is quite clear in the photographs. The NASM airplane has full-span wings, at least proving that the NASM wing set was not part of any of the Dawn Patrol aircraft.

The components undoubtedly emanated from the seventy-six Nieuport 28s operated by the U.S. Army at numerous installations in the 1920s. Without serial numbers by location for these aircraft, it is impossible to place any of the NASM components at any specific military airfield. The period between disposal by the military and acquisition by Paul Mantz is extremely sketchy.

Despite the apparent common sense to that approach, there were several strong reasons not to take this route. First, there are no clues indicating at which Army installation the NASM Nieuport operated, not even a single component of the airframe. It would not only have been a pure guess which airplane it is, but total conjecture even with which airfield it was associated. Further, details on the markings of only a handful of the Army post-war aircraft exist. Painting it as one of these would only in the most remote sense represent the correct aircraft.

They reasoned that if a wing generates lift when presented to an oncoming flow of air, producing differing amounts of lift on either end of the wing would cause one side to rise more than the other, which in turn would bank the entire aircraft. A mechanical means of inducing this differential lift would provide the pilot with effective lateral control of the airplane. The Wrights accomplished this by twisting, or warping, the tips of the wings in opposite directions via a series of lines attached to the outer edges of the wings that were manipulated by the pilot. The idea advanced aeronautical experimentation significantly because it provided an effective method of controlling an airplane in three-dimensional space and, because it was aerodynamically based, it did not limit the size of the aircraft as shifting body weight obviously did. The satisfactory performance of the 1899 kite demonstrated the practicality of the wing warping control system."

For control of climb and descent, the gliders had forward-mounted horizontal stabilizers. Neither craft had a tail. The Wrights' home of Dayton, Ohio, did not offer suitable conditions for flying the gliders. An inquiry with the U.S. Weather Bureau identified Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with its sandy, wide-open spaces and strong, steady winds as an optimal test site.

They began to question seriously the aerodynamic data that they had used. Now at a critical juncture, Wilbur and Orville decided to conduct an extensive series of tests of wing shapes. They built a small wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to gather a body of accurate aerodynamic data with which to design their next glider. The heart of the Wright wind tunnel was the ingeniously designed pair of test instruments that were mounted inside.

While the engine was a significant enough achievement, the genuinely innovative feature of the propulsion system was the propellers. The brothers conceived the propellers as rotary wings, producing a horizontal thrust force aerodynamically. By turning an airfoil section on its side and spinning it to create an air flow over the surface, the Wrights reasoned that a horizontal \"lift\" force would be generated that would propel the airplane forward.

The front of the tube has a larger diameter to accommodate the grill, internal flappers, and combustion chamber with fuel injectors and spark plug, while the rear gradually tapers down to the straight, elongated exhaust. At the front of the missile's aluminum alloy nose fairing is a small propeller for determining range. Inside the missile, behind the wings, are two wire-wound compressed air spheres for the pneumatic control servos. During restoration, the Smithsonian's specimen was found to have these spheres and German inscriptions that confirm that the V-1 in NASM is German, not an American copy known as the JB-2 or Loon. However, the color scheme, borrowed from a V-1 displayed in a British museum, is not authentic, the yellow nose in particular being inaccurate. The operational colors were usually a camouflage pattern of greens and light blue. Moreover, this artifact also lacks the air-log propeller."

        "content": "The V-1 was not radio-controlled; it had a pre-set guidance system which included a magnetic compass monitoring an automatic pilot, which had at its heart a displacement gyro and two rate gyros. Pneumatic signals from the gyros created pressure differentials that were converted to mechanical forces, opening valves for high-pressure compressed air that moved the pistons in the actuators for the rudder and elevators. Roll control was done through the rudder, as there were no ailerons on the wings. Altitude was controlled by an aneroid pre-set in millibars of atmospheric pressure. Maximum altitude was about 10,000 ft, but most bombs flew at only a few thousand feet. When the propeller made a set number of revolutions, a counter fired a detonator in the tail that locked the elevator in a neutral position, cut off rudder control and deployed two hinged spoilers from the underside of the tailplane, causing the missile to a dive on its target."

The V-1 was normally launched from a firing tube mounted on an inclined metal ramp 150 feet long by 16 feet high. Pressurized hydrogen peroxide caused a piston on the ramp to thrust forward, hurling the missile into the air where the pulsejet would be activated once the missile had attained an initial operational speed of 200-mph. During early test flights, before the development of the catapult, solid-fuel rocket boosters were used. The V-1 was also air-launched by modified Heinkel He 111 aircraft. The usual flight time for the V-1, which used low grade aviation gasoline, was about half an hour at altitudes of between two and three thousand feet and speeds of up to 400 mph. The British and Americans called the missile the Buzz Bomb because of the buzzing noise of its air-breathing pulsejet engine, and also the Flying Bomb, Doodle Bug, and Robot Bomb."

Among these was the \"reactor pulse\" concept of the Russian Victor de Karavodine who applied for a French patent on 9 April 1906, which was granted as No. 374,124 on 10 April 1907. His idea was a kind of pulsejet with a low pressure supercharger and sparkplug igniter. The Belgian inventor Georges Marconet applied for a Belgian patent in 1909 for a similar idea meant to be applied to aircraft and was granted French patent No. 412,478. The Frenchmen Barbazat, Lenoir, and René Lorin evolved ideas along these lines. Lorin's concepts, published in the magazine L'Aerophile in 1913 and later in his L'Air et la Vitesse (Air and Speed) (Paris, 1919), were well publicized. Lorin, who claimed his work went back to 1907, advocated the development of long-range missiles for bombarding objectives like Berlin. His designs consisted of both ram and pulsejet type devices."

He conducted experiments at the Munich-Wiesenfeld airfield under support from the Research Division of the Ministry of Transportation. Schmidt was primarily interested in pulsejets for aircraft. He constructed a motor with a duct which produced a thrust of 450 kg (1,000 lbs.) but it was destroyed after only 13 minutes of operation. Nonetheless, the inventor continued to receive support from the Transportation Ministry to 1935 and then from this organization's successor, the RLM or Air Ministry, although the work proceeded slowly. From 1935 to 1940, the Heereswaffenamt (Army Weapons Office) provided additional funds, with which Schmidt established a full-time research group at Munich, with Hans Lembcke as his chief assistant. By 1941, Schmidt produced his SR 500 model; by the following year it generated 1,650 lbs. of thrust, but there were difficulties with its noise level and inefficient fuel spray arrangement."

At first unaware of Schmidt's work, he meanwhile began the design of a similar motor. The Argus motor used a flow valve but the group soon learned of Schmidt's developments and through his cooperation in February 1940, they adopted his superior flap valves, but otherwise the Argus company pursued its own arrangement. There was no further cooperation between Schmidt and Argus, although by 1943 the V-1 pulsejet was called the Argus-Schmidtrohr, or Argus-Schmidt tube. The first successful Argus pulsejet produced a thrust of 300 kg (660 lbs.) and was sufficiently reliable. With modifications, including a fuel regulator, the thrust was increased to 350 kg (770 lbs.). Beginning in April 1941, flight tests were made on cargo gliders and other aircraft with an eye to using the pulsejet as aircraft propulsion, but ultimately the severe vibration it produced made it unusable for that purpose."

All earlier missiles had used reciprocating engines, although missiles using various forms of reaction propulsion had been discussed in Germany since at least 1934. In early 1942, Gosslau proposed to designer Dr. Robert Lusser, who had left Heinkel aircraft and was looking for a job, that they work together on a pulsejet flying bomb, and although Lusser ultimately decided to go to Fieseler Flugzeugbau (Fiesler Aircraft Construction Company) of Kassel, this collaboration came to fruition soon thereafter as an Argus-Fieseler project. V-1 development was accelerated by the British bombing of the old medieval Hanseatic city of Lübeck, which incensed Hitler; on 14 April 1942 he ordered retaliatory \"terror attacks\" against British cities other than London. Two weeks later Argus and Fieseler presented a proposal for a project Erfurt P35, which closely resembled the latter Fi 103 or V-1."

On 10 December the first Fi 103 flight test was made-an air launch from the Fw 200. The first ground-launch test, using a concrete ramp, was made at Peenemünde-West on 24 December in which the missile flew for sixty seconds. In later tests, ranges of 150 miles was achieved with accuracies of a half a mile, but this came only after a long and difficult series of flight tests in which a number of technical problems with the pulsejet and the Askania guidance system manifested themselves."

Up to this time, about 9,000 V-1's, including more than 2,000 abortive missiles or misses, were fired against England. The V-1 campaign against Antwerp and other Belgian cities continued from launch sites in Germany and the Netherlands. The first air-launch of a V-1 took place on 9 July 1944, when Heinkel He 111s of III./KG 3 began attacking London. After the V-1 sites in the Pas de Calais were overrun by Allied troops at the end of August 1944, for many months the only way to attack Britain with V-1 was by air.

Backed by the Model 30's success and flashy styling, the Model 42 seemed destined to win production orders but it failed completely after company politics choked the design process. The senior staff at Bell resented Arthur Young's lack of formal training and ignored his inputs. This led to poor engineering decisions and shoddy quality control during production. Larry Bell also misread the market for the Model 42 and aimed the aircraft at private pilots and their families. In reality, it was commercial operators who needed the unique capabilities offered by the helicopter."

He chose to refine the Model 30 design, install a more powerful engine and side-by-side seating for two, and one of the most successful helicopter designs of the twentieth century resulted. It was the first helicopter designed exclusively for the civil market rather than military customers. Bell called it the Model 47 for the year he introduced it and he sold two versions. The stylish coupe model was again aimed at private owners and again, it did not sell. The utility model hit the commercial market squarely between the eyes. It was lean and utilitarian, stripped of styling gimmicks, and ready for work. Bell enclosed the cockpit beneath a huge, unframed bubble canopy and this distinctive feature is now recognized worldwide."

Army and Marine pilots, flying Model 47s, evacuated over 15,000 wounded personnel during the Korean War with an unprecedented death rate of less than 2 percent. Bell continued to refine the Model 47 design, based on the needs of military and commercial customers. The firm installed more powerful engines and larger fuel tanks to increase range and endurance, and lift larger payloads. Military operations in Korea and sales to the commercial oil industry kept Bell production lines moving at a brisk pace.

Dr. William Leary’s Operation Cold Feet tells the story of this critical life saving device for deep reconnaissance missions. Before the heavy lift helicopter, the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Army used the Skyhook Aerial Recovery System for the retrieval of equipment and materiel. Characteristically, Fulton invented seven separate components that were integrated into one single effective system. The ingenious system was based on the inflation of a small blimp that was dropped or carried by personnel. Aircraft spotted the blimp to which was attached a nylon rope and the personnel in a harness. A wide hooking device attached to the nose of the aircraft, either an HC-130H Hercules or AC-1 Caribou, would snag the line and begin the lift and reel-in process at the back of the aircraft. Skyhook evolved into derivative retrieval systems including: Skyrange (recovery of objects in the air), Searange (recovery of items lying on the water), Seasled (high-speed recovery of quantities of persons in the water with a boat) and others."

Testing had revealed the Tiger Kitten, which was rated at 20 hp, had too little power for the E-2. At full throttle, the small airplane was able only to indulge in 'grass cutting,\" rising a few feet into the air before settling back to earth.

Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle-deck and fairing it into the trailing edge of the wing; he also rounded the wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the break down of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in December 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. Taylor J-2s were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937.

Brakes were soon added too. Powered by 40-hp Continental, Lycoming, or Franklin engines, the J-3 sold for $1,300. Engine horsepower was soon raised to fifty and reached sixty-five by 1940. Piper also standardized the color scheme to Lock Haven Yellow, an orange-yellow later replaced by the lighter Piper Cub yellow with black trim."

In the late 1920s, he realized that a stable, controllable helicopter was one of the few technological challenges of the time that had not shown signs of significant progress, and set about finding a solution. Young approached the development of a practical helicopter in a methodical and scientific manner that was not common practice among many of his fellow pioneers, who relied on trial and error, using full-scale aircraft. Instead, Young used inexpensive, and easily-constructed, remotely-controlled models to test the validity of his theories. This simple expedient allowed him to refine his designs rapidly, and to become recognized as a leader in solving the technical hurdles that had kept helicopter development stagnant for decades. By 1941, Young was flying 1/6-scale models that demonstrated levels of stability and control that were unprecedented in previous helicopter designs. He effectively incorporated Igor Sikorsky’s tail rotor concept, at a time when most helicopter pioneers viewed it as impractical."

This counterbalance system caused the rotor to teeter when the airframe of the helicopter moved in response to turbulence, or control inputs, and dampened further oscillation. This feature allowed an unprecedented level of stability. Other designers were still using hinges to create rotor stability, but those designs relied on a significant lag time in rotor response, which Young had revealed in his experiments to be minimal."

However, Bell had no experience with helicopter design and was looking for someone with a workable concept, when he was introduced to Arthur Young. Bell was immediately impressed with Young’s latest flying model, and they quickly came to an agreement for construction of two full-scale aircraft. The first helicopter was to be a single-seat demonstration aircraft, followed by a two-seat version."

The airframe consisted of a steel tube structure with a specially manufactured magnesium tail boom. Rotor blades were made of a wooden laminate with a metal spar leading edge and balsa filler in the trailing edge. The 160 hp Franklin motor was mounted vertically, which was an improvement over earlier Sikorsky models that required additional weight-consuming gearing for their horizontally mounted engines. Landing gear initially consisted of four spider-like skids. Larry Bell wanted the flight controls to be more like those of an automobile than an airplane, thus the collective pitch lever moved side to side as a replacement for rudder pedals that were likely to be mishandled by novice private pilots who were used to automobile pedals. This feature was later abandoned when it became apparent that the configuration pioneered by Sikorsky would be the industry standard."

It was replaced by an open inverted triangular steel-tube truss that would later become a hallmark of the Model 47. The design team then traded the skid landing gear for a conventional tricycle undercarriage. The tail was destroyed for a second time in a September 1943 crash. At this point Ship 2 had been almost completed and took up the testing slack while Ship 1 was repaired. Upon completion of its repairs, a newly designated Ship 1A rolled out of the shop wearing a new magnesium-skin tail, as well as a strengthened rotor system and landing gear. Ship 1A flew in a series of public demonstrations designed to generate public enthusiasm for the new form of aerial transport, while Young and his workers completed a third Model 30 variant. Ship 3 was a three-seat no-frills version that took full advantage of the lessons learned on the two earlier models. On one occasion, this design flew with seven people on board, most of whom were hanging off the side.

Their inexperience resulted in an unreliable and under-powered aircraft that was priced well beyond the reach of most private citizens.

The Model 47 was chosen over the similar Hiller Model 360, and a short time later, established a sterling reputation as a flying ambulance in Korea.

During the late 1940s, helicopter pioneers began to experiment with alternative propulsion methods that did not require heavy components such as tail rotor assemblies, drive shafts, main rotor clutches, transmissions, and engine cooling blowers. Without these items, a helicopter's useful load increases by a significant margin. These components are also potential failure points, making helicopters more fragile and more difficult to maintain. Yet another advantage is the substantial reduction in the cost to produce helicopters without this equipment. In 1948, Stanley Hiller began to experiment with ramjets mounted on the tips of the main rotor blade. He hoped to make small, ramjet-powered helicopters practical and affordable, and to eventually design and sell giant aerial cranes propelled by ramjets or jet turbine engines. The Hiller HOE-1 became the first production ramjet helicopter, and the Army and Navy flew a small number of these aircraft for a short time to test and evaluate the technology."

The larger the helicopter, the more these parts begin to impinge on the useful load of the aircraft. Modern helicopters have been able to reduce some components necessary to piston engines through the use of gas turbines. In 1948, turbine engines of a size suitable for the small airframe of a helicopter had not been proven reliable to the degree that a manufacturer would be willing to attempt production of such an aircraft. Helicopter pioneer Stanley Hiller, and a number of enterprising competitors employed an alternative solution by using rotor tip mounted ramjets to power a small compact helicopter that demonstrated the technologies he hoped to use in the design of giant aerial cranes. Hiller's design became the first production helicopter to be powered by ramjets, and entered limited military service with both the Army and Navy as a technology demonstrator."

With the financial well being of his company established, Hiller sought out new niches for his lightweight designs, since Bell, Piasecki, and Sikorsky were dominating the market for utility and transport helicopters. Hiller had begun experimenting with tip-jet technology in 1945, as a means of simplifying the increasingly complex and heavy mechanisms necessary for vertical flight. Tip-jet technology originated in World War Two with Baron Friedrich von Doblhoff, an Austrian who developed and flew several practical models. Doblhoff's \"cold-cycle\" tip-jet rotors used high-pressure air from a compressor that was ducted through the rotor blades to their tips to power the blades around at a sufficient rpm to generate lift. Hiller's experimentation initially revealed that a \"hot-cycle\" system, which used exhaust gases and an afterburner type arrangement at the exhaust ducts, created greater efficiency and thrust. However, it did not take Hiller long to recognize that the greatest weight savings, and propulsive efficiency could be gained, by mounting the engines directly onto the tips of the rotor blades."

In 1948, Hiller began work on the HJ-1 Hornet single-seat sport helicopter. The most difficult challenge was developing the ramjet engines, which had seen very little practical use, but were far easier to engineer than jet turbines. The ramjet uses a shaped pipe in a high-speed airflow and the combustion of large quantities of fuel to create a significant pressure differential that produces thrust. The ramjet accomplishes the same effect as a turbine engine but without any moving parts, which results in a considerably lighter and more reliable structure. The disadvantages are that a high-speed airflow must already be established before the ramjet can begin to operate, and the fuel consumption goes well beyond that of a turbine engine. Hiller used the well-established pulse jet design from the German V-1 flying bomb as a starting point, but quickly discarded it in favor of a pure ramjet. A year later, Hiller perfected a ramjet engine that weighed only 5 kg (11 lb.) and put out 14 kg (31 lb.) of thrust when the rotor tip was moving at a maximum operational speed 207 m/sec (680 ft/sec) at 550 rpm. Since the two bladed rotor of the Hornet had one ramjet mounted on each tip a total of approximately 27 kg (60 lb.) of thrust was produced. This does not seem like much, but the only mass that the engines had to move was their own weight in addition to the small, lightweight rotor blades, for which this thrust was more than adequate. Since the rotor was freewheeling, there wasn't any torque that required a tail rotor. The high speed airflow required to start the ramjets was achieved through the use of a small 50 horsepower motor that spun the rotor up to 150 rpm at which point the airflow was sufficient to sustain the operation of the ramjets. Ignition of the fuel, which could be gasoline, kerosene, or fuel oil, was accomplished through the use of a device, similar to a glow plug, referred to as a \"flame-holder,\" which insured re-ignition if the ramjet flamed out."

        "content": "The first single-seat HJ-1, referred to as the utility model, consisted of an open steel and aluminum tube frame that used a rudder for directional control. This design first flew in 1950. The next HJ-1 enclosed the pilot and passenger sitting side-by-side in a cabin made of fiberglass, which was one of the first applications of this new material in the aviation industry. Hiller used this aircraft to begin his marketing campaign for the design while the aircraft was undergoing certification tests with the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA). The third HJ-1, which was the version intended for mass production at a price of $5,000, contained a number of changes. On the first two aircraft, the collective could be moved side-to-side to control the rudder in place of pedals. The new design used rudder pedals to control a small tail rotor. The tail rotor was an asymmetric design that consisted of a single blade balanced by a counterweight, and was driven by the starter motor. The cockpit was also significantly enlarged to accommodate two passengers. These changes increased the weight from 356 lb. to 510 lb., while decreasing the service ceiling to less than 7,000'. Stability of the design was excellent because of the incorporation of Hiller's patented Rotor-Matic servo control system, which allowed the aircraft to maintain a hover with hands off the cyclic. The Hornet series was one of the first helicopter designs to use all-metal rotor blades, which had not been used before that time because previously poor metallurgy often caused structural failure with the rapid flexing that rotor blades experience in flight."

Hiller's limited production capacity was quickly taken up by military orders for his UH-12/H-23, and the HJ-1 program was halted. In 1952, Hiller talked the Navy into purchasing three HJ-1s under the HOE-1 designation, as a possible answer to a Marine Corps request for a flying ultralight vehicle. The Army, which had fallen well behind the Marine Corps in the use of helicopters, was not about to be left out of another project, and placed an order for two HJ-1s under the YH-32 designation. One improvement was retrofitted to the aircraft after they were ordered by the military. The tail boom was extended and two downward canted horizontal stabilizers were installed to improve stability in forward flight. The first HOE-1/YH-32s were not ready for delivery until late 1954, because Hiller was certificating the aircraft to Civil Aviation Authority standards as opposed to military specifications. The Army saw the aircraft as a possible low-cost replacement for its jeep in certain liaison, wire laying, and observation roles, and ordered an additional dozen for extensive field trails, after receiving its first two."

        "content": "The HOE-1 proved to have a number of operational problems that precluded its deployment in the field. The small helicopter could not be safely approached while the rotors were turning since they hung close to the ground. The lightweight construction of the helicopter meant that it could easily be blown off balance in moderate wind conditions. The flames coming out of the ramjets produced an incredibly bright white halo when the HOE-1 was flown at night. This was a considerable disadvantage in the military environment, and the effect prompted a number of UFO sightings when operated in the vicinity of populated areas. The noise generated by the ramjets was also quite considerable, and did not endear the United Helicopter's Palo Alto, California facility to its neighbors. The most serious limitation was the enormous fuel burn of the ramjets, which consumed fuel at approximately ten times the rate of a piston engine providing the same power output. The fuel capacity of the HOE-1/YH-32 was only 136 kg (300 lb.) This had to supply a full power fuel burn of nearly 272 (600 lb.) per hour, which led to a maximum endurance of just over thirty minutes including start-up and shut down. The never exceed airspeed of the helicopter was mere 62 knots, which resulted in a maximum range of less than 30 nautical miles. Hiller appreciated the limitations of the aircraft, but believed the design concept would prove itself once reliable turbine engines could be found to replace of ramjets. However, the centrifugal fuel pumps required for turbines, which would be subjected to several thousand times the force of gravity, needed considerable reengineering before they could reliably be used for a tip-jet design."

        "content": "The HOE-1/YH-32's most worrisome problem was its flight characteristics during autorotation in the event of engine failure. The ramjets created considerable drag on the rotors when they were not running, which necessitated a rapid descent to keep the rotors windmilling at a sufficient rpm to prevent an unrecoverable rotor stall. The rate of descent required during autorotation was nearly 3,000 fpm, which was almost twice that of most other helicopters. Additionally, because the ramjets increased the rotational inertia of the blades to a high degree relative to the weight of the aircraft, the flare into landing out of the autorotation had to be initiated much earlier and more gradually than was done in other helicopters. Flaring out of autorotation usually occurred below 100' in most other types, but this aircraft required a flare to begin between 200' and 300' above ground."

        "content": "The Army and Navy did not employ the HOE-1/YH-32s operationally, but did utilize them in some interesting tests. The effective employment of helicopters into forward combat zones during the Korean War sparked some interest in arming helicopters to provide fire support. Previously the U.S. Air Force had jealously guarded its air support role, and had prevented the Army from pursuing the development of armed helicopters. As the Korean War was ending, the restrictions placed on arming Army aircraft by the National Security Act of 1947 and the subsequent Key-West accords were easing. In 1955, the Army issued its first ever contract for an armed helicopter when it negotiated with United Helicopters to produce two YH-32A ULVs (Ultralight Vehicles). These were bare-bones YH-32s that had their cockpit fairings removed, and the tail rotor replaced by a twin tail boom arrangement that mounted small rudders. The ULVs were nicknamed the \"Sally Rand,\" a well-known burlesque star, because of their stripped down configuration. These three-seat variants were used in 1957 at Fort Rucker, Alabama to test the employment of a wide variety of weapons, including missiles, rockets, and recoilless rifles. The blast of the recoilless rifles had necessitated the change from the tail rotor to rudders. These tests were successful, and proved the viability of the helicopter as a stable weapons platform. However, the performance limitations of the YH-32A did not allow the aircraft to progress beyond its status as a technology demonstrator, and the ULV project was the type's swan song."

        "content": "Hiller's skycrane concept never progressed beyond the design stage. Hughes Aircraft constructed a large turbine powered lifting helicopter, the XH-17, which utilized Doblhoff's principles, but was too inefficient to warrant further development. In the early 1960s, the Army began a competition for the development of a heavy lift helicopter. Hiller responded to the challenge, but the competition was canceled before the design could progress off the drawing board. Hiller later approached NASA to develop a concept for a giant ramjet helicopter in the 1,000,000 lb. class to capture spent Saturn V stages as they parachuted to earth. NASA eventually decided that a reusable space shuttle was a more effective way of overcoming the economic burden of throwaway rockets than trying to catch spent rockets in mid-air with a giant helicopter. Ironically, by this time, Hiller had finally succeeded in overcoming the engineering difficulties in designing reliable tip-jet turbine engines, which would have made such projects feasible. He would not get another chance to develop the technology, before he left his company during the controversial loss of the Army's Light Observation Helicopter (LOH) contract to Hughes aircraft. The remnants of his company began a project to replace the ramjets on one of the old HOE-1s with turbojets, but the company closed its doors before this project was completed."

The aircraft was accepted by the Navy on December 27, 1955 and completed a mere 28.5 hours of flight testing through March 1957 at the U.S. Naval Air Test Center at Patuxent River Naval Air Station in Maryland. Most of this aircraft's flights were short hops under twenty minutes in length. Apparently, some of the HOE-1/YH-32As that have fallen into collector's hands may have managed a few further flights with their new owners, though the type was never certificated for civil operations, because of the difficult autorotation technique required. However, the 8RJ2b ramjet was actually approved for civil use during Hiller's attempts to get the HJ-1 certificated. The 1950s saw a number of attempts by other manufacturers to employ ramjets or other tip-jet propulsion to helicopters. Many of these designs flew successfully, but most were ultimately abandoned because of the same limitations encountered by the Hiller Hornet."

On March 20, 1937, Earhart crashed on takeoff at Luke Field, Honolulu, Hawaii, ending her westbound world flight that had begun at Oakland, California. The Electra was returned to Lockheed Aircraft Company in Burbank, California, for extensive repairs. On June 1, 1937, Earhart began an eastbound around-the-world flight from Oakland, via Miami, Florida, in the Electra with Fred Noonan as her navigator. They reached Lae, New Guinea on June 29, having flown 22,000 miles with 7,000 more to go to Oakland. They then departed Lae on July 2 for the 2,556-mile flight to their next refueling stop, Howland Island, a two-mile long and less-than-a-mile wide dot in the Pacific Ocean."

Wooden gliders were too fragile to store outside and the cost to hangar them was usually beyond the financial means of these modest flyers. The brothers believed that a new glider must be easier to fly than the thousands of wooden, military surplus, training gliders beginning to flood the civilian market. A glider that flew well and easily, they reasoned, would keep new pilots enthusiastic about flying. Franklin E.

Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite.

He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips.

Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name.

The airframe was based on elements of Wright, Curtiss, and Farman designs, three of the most successful manufacturers of the day. It was a biplane with forward and rear elevators, and it had ailerons on both the upper and the lower wings. The airplane was well made and weighed 305 kg (670 lb). It was originally fitted with an engine reworked by Wiseman to generate 50 horsepower. Successful test flights were made in the spring of 1910, making this airplane the first one built in California to fly. By the end of July, several public exhibition flights of limited success were made, but the airplane was underpowered. The original engine was replaced by a 60-horsepower Hall-Scott V-8, which improved the flight performance somewhat."

Attempts to fly the second airplane were only marginally successful, but they were the first of any heavier-than-air craft in Nevada. With modifications to it, Wiseman fared much better with the second airplane the following year when he competed with it in a meet in San Francisco in January 1911. He took second place overall in the novice class. He won the distance event, made the longest sustained flight (just over 6 minutes), and accumulated the most total time in the air, 49 minutes 43 seconds. The performance gave Wiseman national recognition."

He made exhibition flights with the Vin Fiz and took up passengers and gave flight instruction with the Model B. He later moved the airplanes to Long Beach and operated from there. On April 3, 1912, Rodgers was airborne in the Model B, making a test flight after some tuning of the engine in preparation for another passenger ride. Witnesses observed a steep dive as Rodgers apparently attempted to avoid a flock of seagulls. In the next instant he was seen struggling with the controls just before the airplane crashed into the surf, only one hundred yards from his landing spot after the last leg of the transcontinental flight in December. Rodgers was killed instantly. Various causes for the accident were put forth, ranging from a seagull jamming the controls to Rodgers's recklessness or carelessness as a pilot. The precise cause remains undetermined. The wreckage of Rodgers's Model B was acquired by one of his mechanics, Frank Shaffer, and his partner Jesse Brabazon. They rebuilt it and flew for approximately one year until it was destroyed in a crash while being piloted by Brabazon's friend, Andrew Drew, who was killed."

He offered it to the Smithsonian Institution, but it was not accepted on the grounds that it was very similar to the recently acquired Wright Military Flyer. It then passed to Rodgers's wife, Mabel, who, not long after Cal's death, married Charles Wiggin. They exhibited and flew the Vin Fiz publicly for two years, until Rodgers's mother was awarded possession of the airplane in 1914 in a court ruling regarding Cal's estate. The history of the airplane becomes somewhat murky at this point. According to Charles Taylor, the Wright mechanic who assisted Rodgers on the transcontinental flight, Rodgers's mother shipped the Vin Fiz to the Wright factory in Dayton, Ohio, for refurbishment. Either unable or unwilling to pay for the work, she allowed the airplane to languish at the Wright factory and it was destroyed in 1916 after the company was sold. But this version of events is at odds with the fact that Rodgers's mother had the Vin Fiz restored and donated it to the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh in 1917. The airplane was later acquired by the Smithsonian from Carnegie in 1934."

        "content": "The probable explanation for the conflicting information lies in the misconception that there was a single Vin Fiz airframe. On the transcontinental flight, several sets of wings and a large supply of other components and spare parts were brought along on the support train. Rodgers's airplane was repaired and rebuilt many times during the trip. By the time the wheels of the Vin Fiz were rolled into the Pacific at Long Beach, almost nothing of the airplane that took off from Sheepshead Bay remained. As a result, at the end of the journey, there were enough flown, genuine Vin Fiz parts to make up more than one airplane. Charles Taylor was probably accurate when he stated that the Vin Fiz sent to the Wright factory (i.e., the intact airplane that Mabel and Charles Wiggin flew in 1912-14) was destroyed. The airplane that ended up at the Carnegie Institute, and then the Smithsonian, was very likely reconstructed from the parts left over from the many repairs and rebuilds during the flight. Thus, the airplane in the NASM collection is genuine in that it is comprised of components that, at various points, were part of the Vin Fiz during the historic coast-to-coast flight."

In 1996, when it was part of a traveling Smithsonian exhibition, a new wooden mock-up engine was made and placed on the airplane. This was done to reduce potential wear and tear on the artifact caused by repeated removal of the heavy, original engine during assembly and disassembly of the airplane on the many stops of the exhibition tour. The mock-up engine remains on the Vin Fiz."

This world distance record generated publicity that broadcast the superiority of laminar-flow airfoils similar to those first employed on the World War II P-51 Mustang (see NASM collection) but with one crucial difference. Where the Mustang airfoil performed best at high speeds, the RJ-5 wing used a laminar-flow profile tailored specifically to operate most efficiently at low speeds. Harlan Ross had built this wing and Richard Johnson refined it, under guidance from Dr. August Raspet at the Mississippi State University. The success of the RJ-5 marked the beginning of a fundamental shift in the design philosophy of high-performance sailplanes."

Neimi had spent four years learning the aircraft mechanics trade while attending a technical high school in Buffalo, New York, followed by another 6 years working for the Bell Aircraft Corporation and the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, Airplane Division. After a stint in the U. S. Army, Niemi attended the University of Michigan and earned a B. S. in Aeronautical Engineering. He also spent four years performing stress analysis at Bell Helicopter. It is not clear why Niemi chose to name his design the Sisu but it is a popular Finnish word with no precise English equivalent. The term describes a fundamental characteristic of native Finns, their strength, perseverance, and backbone. Aini Rajanen, wrote in \"Of Finnish Ways\" (Barnes & Noble Books: New York, 1984) that Sisu is \"a word that can't be [directly] translated. … Sisu refers not to the courage of optimism, but to a concept of life that says, 'I may not win, but I will give up my life gladly for what I believe.' … Sisu is the only word for the Finns' strongest national characteristic.\""

The first flight in 1958 was so successful that Neimi decided not to sell plans or kits for the homebuilders but to modify the design for production as a finished, ready-to-fly sailplane. He changed the designation to Sisu 1A and lightened the wing structure, added vents to the dive brakes, and introduced slotted flaps to expand the low-speed performance envelope even further. Niemi also increased slightly the area of the vee-tail, elevator/rudder to compensate for increased pitch force from the new slotted flaps, and increased the deflection range of the rudder too. Niemi also introduced the 'plate-stringer' wing structure on the inboard wing sections to reduce weight without compromising the rigidity of the smooth, laminar-flow surface contours. The designer also increased the size of the dive brakes, and lengthened and widened the cockpit to hold bigger pilots."

Construction began on the first four sailplanes in 1960. Pilots quickly snapped up these aircraft but production costs surpassed profits and Neimi had to sell the project to Philip J. Baugh, a retired Air Force pilot and soaring enthusiast from Charlotte, North Carolina. Baugh and Niemi moved the factory to Greenville, South Carolina, in 1963 and the firm became the Sisu Division of the Astro Corporation. Clifton McClure III managed Astro and he and Baugh wisely decided to keep Neimi on as project engineer. McClure was governor of the South Carolina division of the Soaring Society of America. He intended to carry through with Niemi's original plan for the Sisu and obtain Federal Aviation Administration type certification for the design but the daunting costs of such work forced him to abandon the effort. Baugh generously underwrote production of six more Sisus but profits never covered expenditures and metal smiths and technicians finished the tenth and last Sisu 1A in 1965."

He opted for a vee-tail, retractable tow hook and main wheel, and swept-forward wings shaped to a 653418 laminar-flow airfoil. The wingtips leaned ahead of the inner wing sections to insure that the ailerons, hinged just inboard of each wingtip, continued to bite the air and provide the pilot control during a stall. Washout, twisting the wingtips to reduce slightly their angle of attack and lower their stall speed, is a much more common technique but Neimi eschewed it. Twisting the wings, however slightly, would have generated unacceptable drag. The wing surfaces had to be extremely smooth to maintain laminar-flow over a broad speed range and the designer took great care in this area. Neimi used an aluminum plate stringer technique covered with relatively thick, aluminum wing skins to prevent even the slightest buckle. Before applying finish paint, craftsmen checked the wing closely for minute imperfections, covered these depressions with filler paste, and sanded the patch smooth."

Maintaining peace often required covert, real-time, 24-hour surveillance of military and security forces. Among western nations, the political will to launch and maintain limited warfare depended almost entirely on minimizing casualties to service personnel and preventing collateral damage to non-combatants. Friendly units had to first locate and positively identify enemy forces, then launch weapons well beyond threat from enemy defensive fire. Once in flight, missiles, bombs, or other battlefield munitions launched by friendly forces could not miss the target by more than a few meters."

Since the Vietnam War, military forces have used the unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV, to closely track the enemy without incurring their own casualties. One of the most successful UAVs fielded by U. S. forces was the Pioneer RQ-2A. This aircraft has played a significant role in several major conflicts. The UAV dates to World War II when unmanned remotely- controlled aircraft served as primitive, cruise missiles and gunnery targets. On May 1, 1960, Soviet forces downed Francis Gary Powers near Svedlovsk when he over-flew the Soviet Union in a Lockheed U-2 (see NASM collection) reconnaissance jet. This incident was front-page news when President Dwight D. Eisenhower met Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev in Paris a few weeks later. Initial reports that a Soviet surface-to-air missile downed Powers' airplane jump-started the development of reconnaissance UAVs."

When Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982, Israel Aircraft Industries, Ltd., (IAI) was manufacturing the Scout UAV. Successes flying the Scout during the invasion and subsequent flight demonstrations of this UAV's capabilities convinced leaders in the U.S. Navy Mediterranean Fleet to acquire their own Scouts. Reports suggest that the suicide bombing that killed 241 U. S. Marines in Beirut in 1983 also spurred Navy officials to investigate reconnaissance UAVs. In 1984, IAI and Tadiran, Ltd., formed a joint subsidiary company called Mazlat Ltd., to develop an improved version of the Scout known as the Pioneer. The following year, Mazlat flew the Pioneer in a UAV competition sponsored by the Navy. Pacific Aerosystem's Heron 26 UAV competed against the Pioneer for a lucrative Navy contract. Pioneer won and the Navy selected AAI Corporation in the United States to build this UAV."

The data link was jam resistant but operators could switch to a backup mode if the primary frequency was successfully jammed. IAI also developed a Portable Control Station (PCS) for the Pioneer system. Several small, man-portable loads comprised the PCS. This allowed soldiers on the battlefield to assume control once the air vehicle was in flight. Another handy bit of avionics, the Remote Receiving Station (RRS) consisted of a small box with video display that allowed commanders to remotely view real-time imagery transmitted from the Pioneer but independent of the video link to the GCS. A fully equipped Pioneer reconnaissance unit typically consisted of five UAVs and one each GCS, TCU, and PCS, plus four RRS boxes and launch and recovery gear."

During tests, four Pioneers were lost, three of them during attempts to recover the aircraft using the net. Continuing losses during flight and recovery prompted a $50 million expenditure to improve the system.

Still not satisfied with the design and acting on owner suggestions, Piper hired Walter Jamouneau in 1935 to improve the aircraft. Jamouneau designed a true cabin by raising the turtle deck and fairing it into the trainling edge of the wing; he also rounded wing tips and gave the little plane a curved rudder and fin; the Taylor J-2 emerged. However, Taylor's objections to the new design led to the breakdown of his partnership with Piper who then bought out Taylor. Taylor left the company in 1935 to found Taylorcraft Airplane Company in Ohio. About 695 Taylor J-2s Piper were produced at Bradford until the factory burned to the ground in March 1937. Piper moved the company to an old silk factory in Lock Haven, Pennsylvania, and began production again in July. By November the aircraft name changed to Piper.

By the late 1920s and early 1930s, aircraft manufacturers began to cater to the lucrative but limited market of the wealthy sportsman pilot. Charles Lindbergh's 1927 flight from New York to Paris in the Ryan NYP Spirit of St. Louis heightened public awareness of the airplane, but, ironically, it was the depression that further promoted the emergence of light airplanes by making larger aircraft too expensive to operate.

Furthermore, they were simple to fly, easy to maintain, and had no bad characteristics to spring on a novice pilot.

It was given to Guatemala in late 1942, and flew in the Guatemalan Air Force from 1943 to 1954. In 1957, the government of Guatemala donated this P-26A to the Smithsonian Institution. The airplane was restored by the U.S. Air Force for the Smithsonian and was displayed at the U.S. Air Force Museum in Dayton, Ohio, until 1975, when the airplane was brought to Washington, D.C. It is painted in the colors of the 34th Attack Squadron that was stationed at March Field, California."

During 1923 and 1924, Stearman and Beech worked at the Swallow Aeroplane Manufacturing Company as chief designer and vice president/test pilot respectively. The Swallow aircraft met with success, but Stearman and Beech lobbied to try a design with a steel tube, instead of wood, framework. When management declined, Stearman, Beech, and William Snook left Swallow to start their own company, and brought in Clyde Cessna, a successful farmer who liked to build airplanes. They incorporated the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in January 1925 and immediately designed a three-place, open-cockpit, fabric-covered biplane with a Curtiss OX-5 90 hp engine. Stearman had the steel for the tubing tested to his satisfaction at the Agronomy Department at Kansas State Agricultural College, as there were no aviation standards yet in place. Steel tubing braced the cockpit and steel wires braced the fabric-covered spruce spar wings and ribs. Steel was also used for the rudder and elevator leading and trailing edges, and the horizontal stabilizer leading edge, while the vertical stabilizer was spruce. Spruce strips were used to fair the outside of the fuselage and the turtledeck was spruce. Beech wanted redundant control cables running from the cockpit back to two elevators control horns. The landing gear was a standard duralumin speader bar between vees with bungee shockcords."

Ira Beach made the first test flight on March 13, 1925. Travel Airs performed well in the 1925 Ford Reliability Tour and National Air Transport purchased a Model B for its airmail contract work. OX-5 A and B models became Model 2000s in March 1928 with ATC number 30. The Wright J-4 and J-5, significant radial engines that dramatically improved the performance and reliability of aircraft, were then offered on the airframe and, after 1928, those aircraft became the Model 4000. The 4000 found popularity with better performance and versatility through a wide variety of engine, wing, passenger seat, and landing gear combinations. The Speed wing, for example, was a shorter wing with a new airfoil that made the aircraft faster and required a recertification of the airplane to a D-4000. Ted Wells, later the designer of Beech's Staggerwing, owned the first D-4000 that also sported the first NACA cowl built by Travel Air. By early 1927, both Stearman and Cessna had left Travel Air, leaving Walter Beech in charge, and the newest Travel Air was a cabin monoplane. In 1929, Beech allowed the large Curtiss-Wright Company to absorb the company as a division, but it could not survive the depression, and closed in September 1932."

Savage, RAF. His first successful demonstration was at the Derby at Epsom Downs, in May 1922, when Captain Cyril Turner wrote \"Daily Mail\" above the track. Turner then came to the United States in October 1922 and wrote \"Hello U.S.A.\" above New York City. Allan J. Cameron, along with Leroy Van Patten established the Skywriting Corporation of America at Curtiss Field, an American branch of the Savage's original company. They acquired the patents for mixing the writing gas the United States, and, although it was nothing more than light oil fed through the exhaust system, they controlled the market for years. In 1923, using the Skywriting Corporation, the American Tobacco Company launched the first and very successful skywriting advertising campaign for Lucky Strike cigarettes. Pepsi-Cola Corporation became one of the longest-running contractors of skywriting; in the late 1930s and mid 1940s, it contracted or owned a total of 14 aircraft.

In 1968, Scholl bought another DHC-1A and began extensive modifications that resulted in almost a completely new aircraft. He covered over one cockpit to reconfigure the aircraft into a single-place aircraft and installed a (fuel injected) 260 hp Lycoming GO-435 flat-opposed 6-cylinder engine. He removed 20 inches from each wingtip and changed the airfoil section of the tip area. The reduction in span led to the need to lengthen the ailerons inboard to retain control effectiveness. This in turn reduced the flaps to where they became somewhat ineffective, and, since the flaps really were not required for the normal show and aerobatic routines, he removed them as a weight saving measure. These modifications improved the low speed tip stall characteristics and improved roll performance during aerobatic maneuvers."

This caused a tire drag during takeoffs and landings that led to the need for tire replacement after about 10 takeoffs and landings. Other idiosyncrasies were the pitot static tube being fashioned from a golf club shaft and a 3-inch extension added to the cockpit control stick to ease the control loads during the more severe aerobatic routines. Scholl also installed rear-view mirrors on both sides of the cowling just forward of the windscreen.

Shortly before 1 p.m. on February 17, 1986, a tow plane hauled Harris and the Grob 102 Standard Astir III aloft. He unhooked the towline and soon found weak lift that he worked to an altitude of 10,640 m (35,000 ft). Strong lift then pushed the glider up at 182-243 m (600-800 ft) per minute. By the time he had reached 11,552 m (38,000 ft), frost completely covered the canopy and Harris began to fly solely by reference to his instruments.

The Junior also represented a significant diversion for the Curtiss-Wright Corporation, which was almost exclusively oriented to the production of military and heavy commercial aircraft during that time in its history."

The total aircraft flight time was listed as 636 hours. G.C. Acord of Dallas, Texas, who owned the aircraft in 1945 and 1946, had the airframe nearly rebuilt and recovered. L.M. Angevine and R.C.

Early in 1963, the Grafton Water Ski Club in New South Wales, Australia, asked Dickenson to build a kite for an upcoming water ski festival. Dickenson studied the classic flat pentagonal-shaped ski kite and noted its dangerous lack of control and stability. After exploring several ideas, he probably saw drawings of NASA’s Rogallo wings published widely in the popular press. NASA had found no reliable way to deploy the Rogallo wing from a spacecraft, but the wing’s simplicity, low cost, and flight stability may have encouraged Dickenson to choose it for his new ski kite. He made and tested models of a Rogallo-type wing and they showed improved stability, but control was little better than the classic ski kite."

Dickenson’s idea was brilliant and simple, and added little weight. It consisted of a control bar and a seat or harness suspended from the keel tube by a strap. He bolted the control bar directly to the overhead keel tube of the glider and just behind the control bar, and braced it with wires attached to the wing tips. From the hanging strap, he suspended the pilot’s seat. The strap supported the pilot like a pendulum and allowed him or her to shift their weight with ease, pushing and pulling the control bar to make the glider climb, dive, or turn."

On September 8, 1963, as John Dickenson looked on, a ski boat towed his friend Rod Fuller aloft for the first flight of a Rogallo-type wing ski kite with the improved Dickenson control system. By 1966, Dickenson was selling his adaptation of the Rogallo-type wing ski kite fitted with his new control system, and in 1967, he introduced fellow Australian Bill Bennett to the booming sport of flying ski-kites. Bennett quickly set altitude records in hang gliders equipped with Dickenson's control system. By 1969, Bennett had moved to California to sell commercial models under the Delta Wing Kites and Gliders brand name. The excitement of flying and the ease of access to flight provided by the Rogallo wing with Dickenson control appealed to the freewheeling sport leisure culture of the late 1960s, and across America, Bennett's kites grew in popularity."

The entire airframe was constructed without using metal, and weighs only 425 kilograms (939 pounds). Voyager took more than 22,000 work hours and more than 18 months to construct. The long, thin main wing was so flexible that the wing tip deflected upward 0.9 to 1 .5 meters (3 to 5 feet) while the aircraft was in flight.

Two engines, one at each end of the fuselage, powered the aircraft. The highly efficient 110-hp, liquid-cooled rear engine, a Teledyne Continental IOL-200, ran during the entire flight except for four minutes when a fuel problem caused a temporary shutdown. The 130-hp, air-cooled front engine, a Teledyne Continental 0-240, was used for a total of 70 hours and 8 minutes during the initial, heavyweight stage of the flight, and also while climbing over weather and at other critical times. Voyager was equipped with Hartzell constant-speed, variable-pitch aluminum propellers that proved to be a critical factor in stretching the aircraft's range enough to bring it home.

Soon after takeoff, an attempt was made to deliberately dislodge the damaged winglets over Edwards Air Force Base so that if structural damage occurred to the aircraft's fuel tanks, it could land as soon as possible. To dislodge the winglets, the crew increased flight speed and maneuvered the airplane to build up side forces sufficiently high to break them free. About eight kilometers (five miles) from the base the right winglet was dislodged and fell into someone's yard. It is now in storage at the Museum's Paul E. Garber Facility in Suitland, Maryland.

The airplane was conceived when tensions with communist Eastern Europe reached levels approaching a full-blown crisis in the mid-1950s. U.S. military commanders desperately needed accurate assessments of Soviet worldwide military deployments, particularly near the Iron Curtain. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's subsonic U-2 (see NASM collection) reconnaissance aircraft was an able platform but the U. S. Air Force recognized that this relatively slow aircraft was already vulnerable to Soviet interceptors. They also understood that the rapid development of surface-to-air missile systems could put U-2 pilots at grave risk. The danger proved reality when a U-2 was shot down by a surface to air missile over the Soviet Union in 1960."

This proved to be impracticable because of considerable fuel consumption. Lockheed then reconfigured the design for conventional fuels. This was feasible and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), already flying the Lockheed U-2, issued a production contract for an aircraft designated the A-12. Lockheed's clandestine 'Skunk Works' division (headed by the gifted design engineer Clarence L. \"Kelly\" Johnson) designed the A-12 to cruise at Mach 3.2 and fly well above 18,288 m (60,000 feet). To meet these challenging requirements, Lockheed engineers overcame many daunting technical challenges. Flying more than three times the speed of sound generates 316° C (600° F) temperatures on external aircraft surfaces, which are enough to severely weaken the structure of conventional aluminum airframes. The design team chose to make the jet's external skin of titanium alloy to which shielded the internal aluminum airframe. Two conventional, but very powerful, afterburning turbine engines propelled this remarkable aircraft. These power plants had to operate across a huge speed envelope in flight, from a takeoff speed of 334 kph (207 mph) to more than 3,540 kph (2,200 mph). To prevent supersonic shock waves from moving inside the engine intake causing flameouts, Johnson's team had to design a complex air intake and bypass system for the engines."

This treatment became one of the first applications of stealth technology, but it never completely met the design goals."

A-12s, flown by CIA pilots, operated as part of the Air Force's 1129th Special Activities Squadron under the \"Oxcart\" program. While Lockheed continued to refine the A-12, the U. S. Air Force ordered an interceptor version of the aircraft designated the YF-12A.

The M-21 then hauled the drone aloft and launched it at speeds high enough to ignite the drone's ramjet motor. Lockheed also built three YF-12As but this type never went into production. Two of the YF-12As crashed during testing. Only one survives and is on display at the USAF Museum in Dayton, Ohio. The aft section of one of the \"written off\" YF-12As which was later used along with an SR-71A static test airframe to manufacture the sole SR-71C trainer.

Because of extreme operational costs, military strategists decided that the more capable USAF SR-71s should replace the CIA's A-12s. These were retired in 1968 after only one year of operational missions, mostly over southeast Asia.

In addition to an array of advanced, high-resolution cameras, the aircraft could also carry equipment designed to record the strength, frequency, and wavelength of signals emitted by communications and sensor devices such as radar. The SR-71 was designed to fly deep into hostile territory, avoiding interception with its tremendous speed and high altitude. It could operate safely at a maximum speed of Mach 3.3 at an altitude more than sixteen miles, or 25,908 m (85,000 ft), above the earth.

A typical Blackbird reconnaissance flight might require several aerial refueling operations from an airborne tanker. Each time the SR-71 refueled, the crew had to descend to the tanker's altitude, usually about 6,000 m to 9,000 m (20,000 to 30,000 ft), and slow the airplane to subsonic speeds. As velocity decreased, so did frictional heat. This cooling effect caused the aircraft's skin panels to shrink considerably, and those covering the fuel tanks contracted so much that fuel leaked, forming a distinctive vapor trail as the tanker topped off the Blackbird. As soon as the tanks were filled, the jet's crew disconnected from the tanker, relit the afterburners, and again climbed to high altitude."

The general requirements were as follows: that it be designed to be easily assembled and disassembled so that an army wagon could transport it; that it would be able to carry two people with a combined weight of 160 kg (350 lb), and sufficient fuel for 200 km (125 mi); that it would be able to reach a speed of at least 64 kph (40 mph) in still air. This speed performance would be calculated during a two-lap test flight over a five-mile course, with and against the wind. It must demonstrate the ability to remain in the air for at least one hour without landing, and then land without causing any damage that would prevent it from immediately starting another flight. It should be able to ascend in any sort of country in which the Signal Corps might need it in field service and be able to land without requiring a specially prepared spot; be able to land safely in case of accident to the propelling machinery; and be simple enough to permit someone to become proficient in its operation within a reasonable amount of time."

(Wilbur had been flying in Europe the previous year and had thus been absent from Fort Myer in 1908.) The engine was the same as in the earlier aircraft, but the 1909 model had a smaller wing area and modifications to the rudder and the wire bracing. Lt. Frank P. Lahm and Lt. Benjamin D. Foulois, future Army pilots, were the Wrights' passengers. On July 27, with Lahm, Orville made a record flight of 1 hour, 12 minutes, and 40 seconds, covering approximately 64 km (40 mi). This satisfied the Army's endurance and passenger carrying requirements. To establish the speed of the airplane, a course was set up from Fort Myer to Shooter's Hill in Alexandria, Virginia, a distance of 8 km (5 mi). After waiting several days for optimum wind conditions, Orville and Foulois made the ten-mile round trip on July 30. The out lap speed was 37.7 mph and the return lap was 47.4 mph, giving an average speed of 42.5 mph. For the 2 mph over the required 40, the Wrights earned an additional $5,000, making the final sale price of the airplane $30,000."

The Wright Company quoted a price of $2,000 for the upgrade, but advised against it because of the many design improvements that had been made during the intervening two years. The manager of the Wright Company, Frank Russell, learned that the Smithsonian Institution was interested in the first Army airplane and would welcome its donation to the national museum. The War Department agreed and approved the transfer on May 4, 1911. The aircraft was restored close to its original 1909 configuration, but a few non-original braces added for the wheeled landing gear in 1910 remained on the airplane when it was turned over to the Smithsonian. Apart from a few minor repairs over the years, the airplane has not been restored since its acquisition in 1911. Of the three Wright airplanes in the NASM collection, the 1909 Military Flyer retains the largest percentage of its original material and components."

Astronomer Percival Lowell became interested in Mars during the latter part of the nineteenth century, and he built what became the Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona, to study the planet. He argued that Mars had once been a watery planet and that the topographical features known as canals had been built by intelligent beings. The idea of intelligent life on Mars remained in the popular imagination for a long time, and only with the first photographs from Mars by Mariner 4 in 1965 were the hopes of many dashed that life might be present on Mars. This images showed a cratered, ­lunar-­like surface without structures and canals, nothing that even remotely resembled a pattern that intelligent life might produce. U.S. News and World Report announced at the time that “Mars is dead.”"

These were the first sustained landings on another planet in the solar system. While one of the most important scientific activities of this project involved an attempt to determine whether there was life on Mars, the scientific data returned mitigated against the possibility. The two landers continuously monitored weather at the landing sites and found both exciting cyclical variations and an exceptionally harsh climate that prohibited the possibility of life. Atmospheric temperatures at the more southern Viking 1 landing site, for instance, was only as high as +7 degrees Fahrenheit at midday, but the predawn summer temperature was ‑107 degrees Fahrenheit. And the lowest predawn temperature was ‑184 degrees Fahrenheit, about the frost point of carbon dioxide."

Collectively, these missions led to the development of two essential reactions. The first was an abandonment by most scientists that life might exist elsewhere in the Solar System. Planetary scientist and JPL director Bruce Murray complained at the time of Viking about the lander being ballyhooed as a definite means of ascertaining whether or not life existed on Mars. The public expected to find it, and so did many of the other scientists involved in the project. Murray argued that “the extraordinarily hostile environment revealed by the Mariner flybys made life there so unlikely that public expectations should not be raised.” Murray believed that the legacy of failure to detect life, despite the billions spent and a succession of overoptimistic statements, would spark public disappointment and perhaps a public outrage. Murray was right. The immediate result was that NASA did not return to Mars for two decades. The Viking Program’s chief scientist, Gerald A Soffen, commented in 1992: “If somebody back then had given me 100 to 1 odds that we wouldn’t go back to Mars for 17 years, I would’ve said, ‘You’re crazy’.”"

Some asserted that a corrupt Federal government, and its mandarins of science, had found evidence of life beyond Earth but was keeping it from the public for reasons ranging from stupidity to diabolical plots. NASA has had to respond to these charges repeatedly thereafter. This issue first arose on 25 July 1976 when the Viking 1 orbiter took an image of the Cydonia region of Mars that looked like a human face. All evidence suggests that this was the result of shadows on the hills, and Gerry Soffen said so at a press conference, but some refused to accept this position. The “face” remains a sore point to the present, with Soffen being asked about it many times over the years. Always, he stated it was not the remnant of some ancient civilization but was a natural feature lit oddly in this one image but not in any others. As NASA stated officially in 2001, “The ‘Face on Mars’ has since become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film, appeared in books, magazines, radio talk shows—even haunted grocery store checkout lines for 25 years! Some people think the Face is bona fide evidence of life on Mars—evidence that NASA would rather hide, say conspiracy theorists. Meanwhile, defenders of the NASA budget wish there was an ancient civilization on Mars.”"

The blank for this mirror was fabricated by the Corning Glass Works using their high silicon Ultra Low Expansion Glass (ULE 7971). It consists of two 1-inch glass disks fused to the faces of a thin square eggcrate-like support structure. This support structure creates a mirror that weighs about one-fifth that of a solid piece of the same size but retains required rigidity and stability characteristics. The blank mirror was sent to the Kodak Apparatus Division located in Rochester, NY, when they won a NASA contract to create the back-up optical mirror. Kodak ground the mirror surface into the proper concave shape and then polished it to successively finer tolerances using computer-assisted testing routines. The finished mirror was tested and verified by Kodak to meet the strict optical tolerances prescribed by NASA. It was left un-aluminized mirror and delivered to the Perkin-Elmer Corporation in Danbury Connecticut, the prime contractor for the flight mirror, and was stored there until the end of 2000, at which time NASA determined that its value as a display object was greater than its potential value as a telescope mirror. It was then transferred from NASA to NASM by Raytheon, who absorbed Perkin-Elmer."

The six-gallon fuel capacity provided for twenty to thirty minutes of flying time. The engine had no exhaust pipe.

In a pontoon-fitted hydro-aeroplane (possibly an earlier configuration of the NASM aircraft), Ecker was the first to fly in his home town of Syracuse, New York, making a successful takeoff from nearby Onondaga Lake in 1911. By 1912, he was taking passengers aloft and doing exhibitions at fairs and other public gatherings. Some of this exhibition flying was certainly done with the aircraft in the NASM collection, but exactly when and where or in which of its many configurations the airplane appeared is unknown. The only direct reference to the flight history of this airplane is a vague statement made by Ecker in a 1930s newspaper interview in which he said he flew it extensively for a period of three years and then placed it in storage.

Before long, news of the find reached the airplane's original builder and pilot, Herman Ecker, who was by then living out a happy retirement in Florida. Ecker prevailed upon the discoverer of his long-lost flying boat to donate the airplane to the Smithsonian Institution.

He could move a wing or control surface to different positions on the fuselage, testing various configurations more quickly.

Rutan was eager to use N7EZ to explore further the performance of the canard layout.

The key to such rapid construction lay in Rutan's choice of composite construction.

Some builders had disregarded Rutan's fundamental design philosophy-the idea of a simple, lightweight aircraft equipped to operate in daylight and clear weather.

The Walter motor generated about 1,700 kg (3,740 lb) of thrust but a loaded Ba 349A weighed more than 1,818 kg (4,000 lb) so liftoff required more power."

The wingtips and lower fin fit inside guide rails to stabilize the aircraft until it cleared the tower. The flight controls remained locked in neutral position until the solid boosters burned out about 10 seconds into the flight. At burnout, explosive bolts blasted away the solids, the flight controls unlocked, and the Natter's 3-axis Patin autopilot began receiving steering commands from the ground via radio. The airplane continued climbing but the pilot could intercede at any time and take full control. Bachem calculated maximum climb rate at 11,563 m (37, 400 ft) meters per minute but flight tests did not confirm this figure."

At 1000 m (3,200 ft), he fired the explosive bolts and the escape sequence worked as designed. A powered vertical launch failed on December 18 because of faulty ground equipment design. On December 22, the aircraft made its first successful launch with the solid fuel boosters only because the Walter motor was not ready. Ten more successful launches followed during the next several months. Early in 1945, the Walter engine arrived and the Natter launched successfully with a complete propulsion system on February 25, 1945, carrying a dummy pilot. The launch proved that the complete flight profile was workable. All went according to plan, including recovery of the pilot dummy and Walter rocket motor."

Once the German's erected a Natter site, U. S. Army Air Forces strike planners could easily route the bombers out of harm's way. Accuracy of the unguided rocket salvo is also questionable and it was a one-shot opportunity. It is safe to assume that the Bachem Ba 349A Natter was a bad idea from the start and as a bomber interceptor, it was a total failure."

Curtiss, with assistance from Royal Navy engineer Lt. John Cyril Porte, further enhanced the ability of waterborne aircraft to get off the water by constructing a mid-way \"step\" on the bottom of the float or hull. Water has adhesive qualities, especially when running over a curved surface, and early seaplanes had difficulty getting \"unstuck\" from the water, especially in calm seas. The addition of the step helped break up the water flow under the hull enabling the flying boat to get airborne more easily. Curtiss also added breather tubes to the flying boat hull. These were small copper tubes that ran from the inside of the hull to the undersurface step to relieve the low pressure under the hull and assisted the aircraft in becoming airborne."

The first in Sikorsky's successful S-55 series, it solved the center-of-gravity problems of earlier models by shifting the engine to the front and the passenger compartment to beneath the rotor hub. Other innovations included offset-flapping hinges and hydraulically boosted irreversible controls. Designed for the Air Force for arctic rescue, the S-55 served all U.S. military branches throughout the 1950s, especially during the Korean War and in most major military conflicts of the early Cold War. Civilian versions pioneered helicopter airline service in the United States and abroad."

Glider pilots had a variety of options available but all were relatively cumbersome and sometimes dangerous, and required other pilots, drivers, or ground personnel. The most convenient method was to take off in tow behind either an automobile or a powered aircraft. When gliding and soaring began in Germany shortly after World War I, groups of healthy people ran down hills and towed the motor-less aircraft into the air attached to elastic 'bungee' chords. Bungee launches were very popular in Europe but the wider availability of auto and airplane tows, and the hot and humid weather in North America, prevented this labor-intensive alternative from migrating to the New World. Powered winches also pulled gliders aloft but this technique could be risky and required a certain degree of pilot skill. It also demanded a skilled winch operator."

To return the aircraft to the home base required another considerable expenditure of group labor. A ground crew first disassembled the glider into manageable sections, then loaded the pieces aboard a special glider trailer and hauled them back by road. Glider enthusiasts spent more time preparing to fly, rather than actually flying, than any other group in aviation. The solution to this imbalance between fun and work was to motorize the glider and allow the pilot to self-launch. This idea appeared simple in theory but it proved more complicated in practice."

The second problem lay in streamlining the propeller and motor to reduce drag once the pilot silenced the engine and began to glide."

The Winnie Mae would then continue on its flight and land on a special metal-covered spruce landing skid glued to the fuselage. During these flights, Post wore a special pressure suit, the world’s first practical pressure suit and an important step on the road to space. The suit was the third type developed by Post and Russell S. Colley of B. F. Goodrich Company. It consisted of three layers: long underwear. an inner black rubber air pressure bladder, and an outer cloth contoured suit. A special pressure helmet was then bolted on the suit. It had a removable faceplate that Post could seal when he reached a height of 17,000 feet. The helmet had a special breathing oxygen system and could accommodate earphones and a throat microphone. The suit could withstand an internal pressure of 7 psi. Bandolera-type cords prevented the helmet from rising as the suit was pressurized. A liquid oxygen container, consisting of a double-walled vacuum bottle, utilized the natural \"boil off\" tendencies of supercold liquid oxygen to furnish gaseous oxygen for suit pressurization and breathing purposes. This early full pressure suit is the direct ancestor of full pressure suits used on the X-15 research airplane and manned space voyages. The Winnie Mae, its special jettisonable landing gear, and Post’s pressure suit are in the collection of the National Air and Space Museum."

        "content": "The Albatros series of single-seat fighters produced between 1916 and 1918 were among the most numerous and distinctive aircraft of the First World War. The Albatros Werke began to build airplanes in 1910. Early in the war, the firm focused on two-seat observation types. In 1916, in response to the fading superiority of the Fokker monoplane to the French Nieuport 11 and the British de Havilland D.H.2, the German government requested the nation's aircraft companies to produce a suitable replacement for the Fokker. Albatros Werke chief designer, Robert Thelen, with his assistants Gnaedig and Schubert, offered a remarkably advanced design, the Albatros D.I. It featured a streamlined semi-monocoque fuselage, with an almost fully-enclosed in-line Mercedes engine and the propeller spinner neatly contoured into the nose of the fuselage. The D.I was quickly modified into the very similar D.II, which had the upper wing repositioned slightly to improve visibility for the pilot. Both fighters entered front-line service in the fall of 1916 and immediately demonstrated strong advantages over their Allied counterparts. Powered by a 160-horsepower Mercedes engine and armed with two machine guns, the Albatros fighters used speed and firepower to overwhelm the lighter, more maneuverable Nieuports and D.H. 2s."

The Albatros D.III was introduced early in 1917 and it met with instant acceptance by the German pilots. It was easy to fly and was an effective combat aircraft. The principal design change was the use of a narrow-chord lower wing, similar to the sesquiplane wing arrangement of the agile Nieuport fighters. This increased maneuverability as well as improving the pilot's field of view. Initially, the narrow lower wing was susceptible to frequent failure in prolonged dives, but with reinforcement of the structure and improved workmanship, the problem was ameliorated. The Albatros D.III served with great success throughout the first half of 1917."

Thelen was forced to refine the sleek Albatros design further in an effort to gain parity with the new Allied fighters. In the D.IV model, Thelen reverted to the equal-width upper and lower wings of the D.I and D.II. The nose was even more streamlined than the D.III and the rudder had a more rounded shape. An experimental geared version of the 160-horsepower Mercedes engine was fitted to the D.IV prototype. But despite its racy appearance, the performance of the D.IV was not up to that of the D.III, and the experimental geared engine was problem-ridden. Thus, no production run of the D.IV was ordered."

        "content": "The Albatros D.V returned to the sesquiplane wing design of the D.III. Initially it was powered by the same 160-horsepower Mercedes engine used in the D.III, but later it was replaced by an up-rated model that delivered approximately 180 horsepower. The major new innovation was the D.V's elliptical cross-section fuselage, compared to the flat-sided fuselage of the earlier models. Primarily because of changes in the nature of the construction of the elliptical fuselage, the D.V was approximately 32 kg (70 lb) lighter than the D.III, and this improved performance marginally. But hopes for the new version were soon undermined by a rash of upper-wing spar failures shortly after the D.V was introduced. To remedy the problem, the wing ribs and the spars were strengthened, resulting in a re-designation, the D.Va. Unfortunately, the necessary strengthening of the airframe made the overall weight of the D.Va 23 kg (50 lb) more than the D.III, negating the performance improvement of the newer model. The D.V and D.Va also continued to experience the same lower wing failure problems in a dive of the earlier D.III. A small auxiliary strut was added at the bottom of the outer wing struts to address the issue, but was not entirely successful. Even so, the D.Va remained in production until April 1918, when the superior Fokker D.VII appeared."

It is apparent, however, that the airplane is comprised of components from more than one Albatros. The individual wings show evidence of workmanship of different quality, suggesting that they were not produced at the same time and at the same place. Further, before restoration, there were straight crosses as well as the earlier Iron Cross national insignia on different components of the airplane."

This unit was formed at Graudenz on December 17, 1917, as part of Germany's Amerika Program, an effort to build up German strength rapidly and deliver a decisive blow to the West before American resources could be brought to bear for the Allies. Under the program, the number of German fighter units doubled. The inferred production date from the serial number of the NASM Albatros fits with the creation and equipping of Jasta 46 with Albatros fighters. Evidence that the NASM Albatros did see combat is damage from a bullet that passed through the right machine gun mount, penetrated the emergency fuel tank, and then lodged in the right magneto. The airplane was unlikely to have flown again as the fuel tank had not been repaired."

The first record of the NASM Albatros in the United States is the presentation of the airplane to the De Young Memorial Museum in San Francisco on July 13, 1919, by Congressman Julius Kahn. It is unclear how Congressman Kahn became associated with the Albatros, but a label placed with the airplane at that time credited it as a gift from the French government. Some years later, NASM curator Paul Garber learned of the Albatros at the De Young Memorial Museum. On a trip to California in January 1947, he located the airplane and approached the museum about donating it to the Smithsonian. Garber was informed that it had recently been sold at auction for $500.00 to George K. Whitney, who planned to display it at Playland near Cliff House, a local San Francisco tourist stop. After Garber explained the importance of the historic aircraft to Whitney, he agreed to donate it to the Smithsonian, with the condition that the museum pay the packing and transportation costs. After a lengthy delay until funds were available, the Albatros was moved to the museum's temporary storage facility in Park Ridge, Illinois, in August 1949. It was brought to Washington, D.C., in 1952 and remained in storage until restoration began in January 1977. The complex and meticulous rebuilding of the NASM Albatros D.Va was completed in February 1979."

Soon the BD-2 followed with the ambitious design goal to fly non-stop around the world without refueling. Bede never made the flight but the project stirred considerable interest among designers and pilots.

Though promising a lot of bang per buck, years of hard and difficult work remained to make the BD-5 idea practical.

Bede mounted the wings low and depending on the version, they spanned (4.3 m/14 ft 4 in span) on the BD-5A, or just over 6.4 m (21 ft) on the BD-5B. The 'A model appeared in most of the early brochures and other advertising but as development continued, it became apparent that the airplane flew much better with the longer wings. To move about on the ground, Bede fitted tiny, retractable, tricycle landing gear. He minimized the physical attributes of the BD-5 to increase performance with small engines and to reduce the cost to fabricate components. Small size appealed to many homebuilders who were loath to take on projects that required more building space than a garage or apartment. Bede designed the wings to separate quickly and easily from the fuselage. This feature allowed the builder to store the BD-5 at home rather than paying to rent a hanger at the airfield."

As is standard practice within the amateur-built aircraft community, builders had to form, cut, drill, bond, and rivet a variety of raw materials provided by Bede's staff into a finished BD-5 according to a detailed set of instructions. To reduce building time, Bede technicians formed a few of the more critical parts with complex shapes, such as the fuselage skins. Jim Bede sold the first kits for $2,100 and estimated that after toiling about 300-400 hours, the average builder could be ready to fly. Many variables always influence such predictions so kit manufacturers wisely pad their estimates, however Bede's projection appeared remarkable because the airplane was not a simple design of modest performance, but rather a genuine thoroughbred that demanded a high degree of skill and precision to build and fly."

Nearly all who flew the airplane called the handling qualities delightful. Small size and careful design made the control pressures were very light but the characteristic was due also to Bede's use of stiff aluminum push-rods supported on ball bearings to all control surfaces with the pilot's control stick and rudder pedals. One pilot described how he simply 'thought' himself into a turn, with little or no awareness that sensation of manipulating the controls. Quite pleasant in the air, such light control pressures could be deadly on takeoff when inexperienced pilots moved the controls too abruptly and lost control. There was no fix for this characteristic and pilots new to flying the BD-5 received stern warnings to use extreme caution until they were familiar with the tiny movements required to fly the BD-5. Advertised as 322 kph (200 mph), maximum cruise speed was as impressive as the handling, the result of not only a very clean and streamlined configuration, but also the small size and low weight, about 270 kg (600 lb). It was said that the little airplane behaved equally well at the opposite end of the performance spectrum but the statement that the BD-5 could slow down to soar like a motor glider was certainly a stretch unless really extraordinary weather conditions were encountered. Bede also claimed that the power plant sipped just 4 gallons per hour of fuel to give the airplane sufficient range to fly about 1,610 km (1,000 miles) at an altitude of 4,256 m (14,000 ft)."

His first engine was a 40 horsepower unit manufactured by Kiekhaefer Aeromarine that proved unreliable. Next he tried an engine manufactured in Germany by Hirth in versions that developed from 40 to 70 horsepower. After Hirth announced that the firm could not supply enough power plants to meet projected kit sales, the most difficult problem for BD-5 kit owners remained the engine.

During the flight, Fred and Al Key took turns manning the controls and sleeping on the extra fuel tank behind them in the cabin. They received food, fuel, and supplies 432 times through a sliding roof hatch from another Robin. A metal catwalk on the forward section of the aircraft made in-flight maintenance and lubrication of the engine possible. Their Wright Whirlwind engine consumed 6.500 gallons of gasoline, at a rate of 10 gallons per hour, and 300 gallons of oil.

Unlike a helicopter, an engine does not drive the rotor blades while the aircraft is in flight. Instead, the resultant of the lift and drag forces acts to pull the blade forward in rotation while also creating lift - the same effect that turns the sails on windmills. This state of autorotation is only possible with a sustained airflow through the rotor disc, with the air moving from below and in front of the rotor to above and behind it. The gyroplane requires some propulsive force to maintain sufficient speed to sustain autorotation and hold altitude. In the Cierva and Pitcairn Autogiros, an engine driving a tractor propeller supplied the necessary force. If the pilot reduced throttle while flying, the rotors would begin to slow and the autogiro would descend. The increased airflow of the descent allowed the rotors to continue in autorotation and maintain the blades in an unstalled condition - even without the forward pull of the propeller. Although the pilot still had to keep some forward motion for a landing flare-out, and to maintain airflow over the control surfaces, it allowed for unpowered and near vertical descents ending in a very short landing rollout. This was an excellent safety feature in case of engine failure. Nonetheless, until the advent of direct control gyroplanes, the diminished control effectiveness in slow speed flight required a highly experienced Autogiro pilot to perform minimal landing rollouts. Without a powered rotor, gyroplanes are incapable of hovering, though later designs did include rotor spin-up mechanisms that allowed near-vertical \"jump\" takeoffs."

Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in).

The minimal takeoff and landing rolls of Pitcairn's proposed Autogiros promised that the well-to-do could operate from their lawns, while conventional aircraft were becoming increasingly tied to the fixed infrastructure of the local airfields. Unfortunately, Pitcairn's timing was technically fortuitous but commercially disastrous as his new autogiro venture coincided with the advent of the Great Depression. Despite the best efforts of numerous entrepreneurs, general aviation was to remain the purview of the wealthy throughout this period and the company struggled to survive. Most of the company's Autogiro sales were to demonstration pilots who made their living performing at airshows and using the aircraft as a highly visible flying billboard, either on its own or towing banners."

The C.8W did much to publicize the Autogiro during the development of Pitcairn's initial design, the PCA-1 (see NASM Collection). By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration. Also in the audience was the Spanish ambassador, who had come to see one of his nation's greatest aeronautical contributions in action. Two years later, Pitcairn's first production model, the PCA-2, would land on the South Lawn of the White House."

One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s."

After the C.8W finished its useful life as a testbed upon completion of the PCA-1 series of experimental Autogiros, it lay dormant for a brief time. Pitcairn then decided to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution's repository of historic aircraft at the urging of Paul Garber, who attended to the Smithsonian's aeronautics collection. The last flight of the C.8W occurred on July 22, 1931, when Pitcairn test pilot Jim Ray landed the aircraft on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian \"Castle\" after a 209-kilometer (130-mile) flight from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles Abbott, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, personally accepted it into the national collection. The aircraft currently awaits restoration and display. Harold Pitcairn stated at the presentation that \"the time is fast approaching when the air will hold a vast number of similar but more perfected machines, all engaged in the everyday social and commercial activities of our people.\" The gyroplane was unquestionably a safe and economical means of solving the short takeoff and landing problem that had troubled aeronautical engineers for decades. However, the type's limited payload and low airspeeds usually made it a poor substitute for conventional airplanes in the eyes of most operators. Unfortunately, the Autogiro failed to become a widespread commercial success. The advent of the commercial helicopter in the 1940s, with its unique ability to hover, quickly displaced the gyroplane as the predominant rotary-wing aircraft."

Shortly after Pitcairn began testing the C.8W, Cierva contacted him and suggested that he add upturned wingtips with a 45-degree dihedral to improve its stability. This addition, tried initially on Cierva's C.12, increased the wingspan by an additional 0.73 meters (2 ft 4 in). The modification worked extremely well, and was a staple on almost all winged autogiros until the advent of wingless, direct-control versions."

His engineering team experimented with new tail designs for the C.8W, developed by Cierva for the C.19, which deflected propwash upward into the aft section of the rotor disc. This helped to bring the rotors into a state of autorotation in preparation for a minimal takeoff run."

The minimal takeoff and landing rolls of Pitcairn's proposed Autogiros promised that the well-to-do could operate from their lawns, while conventional aircraft were becoming increasingly tied to the fixed infrastructure of the local airfields. Unfortunately, Pitcairn's timing was technically fortuitous but commercially disastrous as his new autogiro venture coincided with the advent of the Great Depression. Despite the best efforts of numerous entrepreneurs, general aviation was to remain the purview of the wealthy throughout this period and the company struggled to survive. Most of the company's Autogiro sales were to demonstration pilots who made their living performing at airshows and using the aircraft as a highly visible flying billboard, either on its own or towing banners."

The C.8W did much to publicize the Autogiro during the development of Pitcairn's initial design, the PCA-1 (see NASM Collection). By the spring of 1929, Pitcairn was under considerable pressure from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA - the forerunner of NASA) to make the C.8W available for viewing. No one in the United States other than Pitcairn and his staff were well versed in the engineering challenges posed by the autogiro, and the aviation industry was beginning to grow anxious for the opportunity to examine the novel craft. Pitcairn undertook the first rotary-wing cross-country flight in the United States on May 13, 1929 when he flew the C.8W more than 805-kilometers (500-miles) from Bryn Athyn to Langley, Virginia, for the annual NACA conference. He flew via Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Richmond, attracting considerable crowds at each of his stops. After impressing notables at the conference, including Orville Wright, he flew to Norfolk to demonstrate the Autogiro to Navy officials, who were naturally intrigued about an aircraft with the potential to operate easily from naval vessels. Shortly after making the return flight, Pitcairn flew the C.8W to Washington for a demonstration before Congress and members of President Hoover's administration. Also in the audience was the Spanish ambassador, who had come to see one of his nation's greatest aeronautical contributions in action. Two years later, Pitcairn's first production model, the PCA-2, would land on the South Lawn of the White House."

One innovation was the use of a steel spar instead of the wooden one employed on the C.8W. Pitcairn's continuing frustration over the rotor spin-up problem led to his incorporation of an important autogiro development - a clutch that allowed the engine to bring the rotor rpm up before flight. This was not possible in flight because there would have been no means of counteracting torque - something that the friction of the tires accomplished while the aircraft remained on the ground. However, this important development did set the stage for the jump-takeoff autogiros that appeared in the late 1930s."

After the C.8W finished its useful life as a testbed upon completion of the PCA-1 series of experimental Autogiros, it lay dormant for a brief time. Pitcairn then decided to donate it to the Smithsonian Institution's repository of historic aircraft at the urging of Paul Garber, who attended to the Smithsonian's aeronautics collection. The last flight of the C.8W occurred on July 22, 1931, when Pitcairn test pilot Jim Ray landed the aircraft on the National Mall in front of the Smithsonian \"Castle\" after a 209-kilometer (130-mile) flight from Willow Grove, Pennsylvania. Dr. Charles Abbott, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, personally accepted it into the national collection. The aircraft currently awaits restoration and display. Harold Pitcairn stated at the presentation that \"the time is fast approaching when the air will hold a vast number of similar but more perfected machines, all engaged in the everyday social and commercial activities of our people.\" The gyroplane was unquestionably a safe and economical means of solving the short takeoff and landing problem that had troubled aeronautical engineers for decades. However, the type's limited payload and low airspeeds usually made it a poor substitute for conventional airplanes in the eyes of most operators. Unfortunately, the Autogiro failed to become a widespread commercial success. The advent of the commercial helicopter in the 1940s, with its unique ability to hover, quickly displaced the gyroplane as the predominant rotary-wing aircraft."

When the United States entered World War Two, Hiller converted his production line to C-47 window frames. By 1942, he had progressed far enough on his helicopter designs to form a new company, Hiller Aircraft, to begin construction on what was to become the XH-44. Hiller and his small group of experienced engineers and craftsmen had completed the first components for the small steel-tube and fabric-covered helicopter by December 1942. As had happened in the construction of Frank Piasecki's PV-2 (see NASM collection), limited financial resources and wartime shortages and restrictions meant that the staff had to scrounge or manufacture almost all their own components. Hiller also selected the same Franklin 90 hp engine (de-rated to 65 hp) to power the X-44 that Piasecki used in the PV-2. Unfortunately, the engine was not commercially available, and Hiller had to plead his case before several government agencies before one was made available to him. The engine was installed in late 1943, and testing began immediately."

Hiller had selected this unusual coaxial configuration for several reasons. The design was already proven in what can be regarded as the first practical helicopter, the Bréguet-Dorand Laboratory Gyroplane, which first flew in 1935. While the mechanism that allowed the rotors to turn in opposite directions was somewhat complex, it allows other weight-consuming components to be eliminated. Direction control was accomplished through cyclic pitch control as on most other helicopters."

        "label": "Long Description",
        "content": "In a single rotor helicopter, hinges must be incorporated to allow the blades to flap cyclically to assist in maintaining the same lift on the advancing side of the rotor disc as on the retreating side. On a coaxial helicopter each rotor counteracts the differential lift created on the other, and eliminates the potential loss of control because of retreating-blade stall. Also, as torque is cancelled, out there is no need for a tail rotor that robs a considerable percentage of engine horsepower. The absence of the tail boom, as well as the tail rotor and its transmission, results in considerable weight savings and reduces drag. The greatest penalty for coaxial helicopters comes from the requirement to have very strong \"rigid\" rotor blades to eliminate flapping which could bring the rotors into contact with each other. As a result, Hiller produced the first practical all-metal blades. These blades held up far better than those of Hiller's competitors, which were made largely of wood and covered with fabric. This resulted in lengthy manufacturing times, difficulty in balancing, and severe quality control problems. The coaxial configuration did have some defects, including poor directional control in forward flight and yaw control reversal in autorotations."

One of the XH-44's great selling points as a home-based commuter aircraft was the absence of a highly dangerous tail rotor."

Test flying was a slow and tedious process, because Hiller did not have any prior flight experience, and had to teach himself to fly the XH-44 while test flying it. During this process, the XH-44 was securely tethered, though on the first flight test, made in the driveway of Hiller's family residence, the tether was not adjusted properly and the helicopter tipped over resulting in minor damage. Subsequent testing was completed in the University of California at Berkeley's football stadium. On July 4 1944, Hiller flew the bright yellow craft freely for the first time in the stadium. A public demonstration followed on August 30, 1944 in San Francisco. This event and others like it successfully attracted outside investment, primarily in the form of Henry Kaiser, a wealthy Seattle ship-builder. The infusion of Kaiser's capital allowed Hiller to further refine the XH-44."

No contracts were forthcoming but a refined version, the UH-4, was prepared for production as a commuter aircraft. Unfortunately, the personal aircraft boom that had been forecast for the postwar period did not materialize, and Hiller began to work on a more conventional utilitarian design."

The rotormatic components revolutionized helicopter stability, but the mechanism was adaptable to a coaxial rotor system. Hiller made the decision to adopt the single main rotor with anti-torque tail rotor configuration for his next design the UH-12. This highly successful helicopter was to have the longest production run in history. However, the Hiller Aircraft Company continued to pursue advanced helicopter technology, focusing largely on small lightweight designs such as the foldable YROE rotorcycle (see NASM collection), and the X-18 tilt-wing. The coaxial design has since been abandoned by American manufacturers, but the Russian Kamov design group manufactured a number of the type, beginning at the height of the cold war and continuing through to the present day. These designs proved invaluable as their lack of a tail boom and rotor allowed the relatively large helicopters, used largely for anti-submarine warfare, to be easily stowed on a wide variety of naval vessels."

Wishing to preserve this historic and rare airplane, he asked Ken Hyde of Warrenton, Virginia, to restore the aircraft to Edmondson's red and white paint scheme. The airplane flew again in October 1974 and it was then lent to the Shannon Air Museum in Fredericksburg, Virginia. McCulloch donated Little Butch to NASM on December 29, 1981."

Pitts began with an idea for an aerobatic aircraft that would defy gravity and be crisp on the controls. Rather than the larger pre-war biplanes, Pitts wanted something smaller that would climb, roll, and change attitude much more quickly. Instead of a large radial engine, Pitts built his aircraft around the new smaller and lighter horizontally-opposed engines. The swept wing allowed for access and center of gravity (CG) factors and made snap rolls snap more sharply. The resulting Pitts Special was revolutionary because of its small size, light weight, short wingspan, and extreme agility."

To meet the maximum speed targeted in the proposal (520 kph or 323 mph), Martin's design pushed the wing loading to a higher level than that of any other Air Corps airplane. The design looked great on paper and the Air Corps ordered 201 aircraft in September. The first production example flew on November 25, 1940. However, the high wing loading dramatically increased landing and take off speeds. The airplane also suffered from many engine and propeller malfunctions. All these factors combined to cause many accidents in training.

Many nosewheel strut failures delayed the transition to full operational status but the first airplanes flew combat missions in the Pacific not long after the American entry into World War II. On June 4, 1942, four Army Air Corps Marauders defending Midway island attacked Japanese aircraft carriers with torpedoes but failed to score hits. It was soon obvious that the B-25 Mitchell required less runway for takeoff and had greater range than the B-26 so U. S. Army Air Force (AAF) planners shifted all Marauders to Africa and the European Theater of Operations. The Mitchell became the preferred type in the Pacific. The 319th BG became the first Marauder outfit sent to England. During a familiarization flight, one ex-Tokyo raider crashed and the Group CO (commanding officer) and a Squadron CO became lost over France and were shot down and killed. During this mission, 18 men died, four aircraft were destroyed, and four damaged. The Army Air Forces sent Marauders on to North Africa after the Allies invaded that continent in November 1942. By the 21st of that month, the last 319th B-26 had arrived in Algeria. Out of 57 bombers that left the U. S., only 17 made it to Africa.

Eleven Marauders flew to Ijmuiden, Holland, to knock out a power station that they had failed to hit three days earlier. Flying the same route, in one of the costliest missions of the war, ten bombers were lost and one aborted. But as time went on, the Marauders were to redeem themselves and achieve a record of successes that more than compensated for earlier shortcomings. In June military planners ordered a halt to low-altitude bombing. Henceforth, all medium bombers would fly at medium altitudes, about 3,000 m (10,000 ft). During July 1943, the 3rd Bomb Wing flew the first Marauder missions without losses, thanks largely to escorting Spitfires that were employed in a 4 to 1 ratio of fighters to bombers. In fact the fighters could order the bombers to scrub a mission if conditions became too unfavorable. Marauders also operated in the Mediterranean and made their first mission on June 5, 1943. The 319th BG pioneered 3-ship and later 6-ship abreast formation takeoffs while operating from Decimomannu, Sardinia, during October 1943.

By 1911 he had built several airplanes and had gained extensive experience as an exhibition pilot. He began testing a new airplane in the spring of 1911. It was similar to the basic Curtiss pusher design that was becoming quite popular with builders by this time, but it was innovative in that it had steel-tube structural components. It was powered by a 60-horsepower Hall-Scott V-8. Baldwin called his new machine the Red Devil III, and thereafter each of his airplanes would be known as a Baldwin Red Devil. Baldwin built approximately six Red Devils. Most were powered by the Hall-Scott, but Curtiss engines were also occasionally used. By mid-1911, Baldwin was training pilots, taking up passengers, and performing regularly with Red Devil aircraft at air meets. He advertised Red Devils for sale into 1913."

        "content": "Thomas Scott Baldwin was one of the more significant aviation figures of the pioneer era, even though his name is relatively unknown today. He was born in 1854, and after a stint as a brakeman on the Illinois railroad as a youth, he joined the circus as an acrobat. One of the circus attractions was a balloon with which Baldwin ascended seated on a trapeze suspended beneath. He made his first trip aloft in 1875. Soon he enhanced the act by performing acrobatics on the trapeze at several hundred feet, which, by 1885, led to parachute jumps from the balloon. His successful daring quickly led to a world tour, including a special performance before the Prince of Wales in London. Baldwin's manager for the tour billed him as \"Captain\" Baldwin, a nickname by which he would be known from then on."

Among the most famous was the California Arrow, powered by a small Curtiss engine and piloted by Roy Knabenshue at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. In 1905, the Baldwin Airship Company was incorporated, and Captain Baldwin soon became a major name in the early American aviation circles. In 1907, the Baldwin company was commissioned by the U.S. Army Signal Corps to build a 600 cu m (20,000 cu ft) capacity airship. The 29 m (96 ft) long non-rigid was powered by a 20-horsepower Curtiss engine, traveled at a speed of 20 mph, and had a total lifting capability of 617 kg (1,360 lb). It was tested successfully for the Army in August 1908 and was designated the SC-1."

It was a tractor biplane with a biplane tail similar to the well-known Farman design, and it had a large vertical surface mounted above the top wing for lateral steering. The original 25-horsepower, four-cylinder Curtiss engine was quickly replaced by a Curtiss V-8. By the summer of 1910, Baldwin was testing a second airplane at Mineola, Long Island. This aircraft was similar to the Curtiss biplanes of the day, featuring a centrally-mounted pusher engine and a forward elevator supported by booms ahead of the wings."

Baldwin called his new machine the Red Devil III, and thereafter each of his airplanes would be known as a Baldwin Red Devil. The origin of the name appears to stem from Baldwin's painting his aircraft bright crimson overall. There is also an unsubstantiated story that following an accident, Baldwin emerged from the wreckage of his airplane angrily voicing some choice phrases in the presence of a young girl who had witnessed the incident. The girl purportedly left the scene sneering at Baldwin, \"old red devil.\" Whatever the truth of the origin of the name, Baldwin's distinctive red airplanes were collectively known as Red Devils."

Also, it has single ailerons mounted between the wings, rather than the trailing edge ailerons on both wings that were typical of other Red Devils. One photograph exists of a Red Devil with no forward elevator and trailing edge ailerons, as well as a picture of yet another with a forward elevator and single interplane ailerons, thus demonstrating that the unusual features of the NASM airplane did appear on other confirmed Red Devils. Unfortunately, no picture of the NASM Red Devil exists showing the airplane before the First World War, when it was presumably built and flown. Another apparent difference of the NASM airplane is the engine type. It came to the museum with a 50-horsepower Maximotor B-4 installed. Although no contemporary documentation cites any Red Devils as powered by a Maximotor, the holes in the engine mount of the NASM airplane suggest that this was the original engine in this airframe."

Nothing is known of how, when, or from whom Roosevelt Field acquired the airplane. Indeed, its only documentation as even being a Baldwin Red Devil is its characterization as such by Roosevelt Field. Nevertheless, the steel-tube structural components and general design of the NASM airplane are consistent with known features of Baldwin Red Devils. So there is little reason to doubt that it is a Red Devil."

The purpose of the project was to evaluate technologies for a successor vehicle to the Space Shuttle. Researchers targeted the thermal protection system for improvement and innovation, seeking a more durable and more easily installed heat shield that would require less maintenance than Shuttle tiles. This lightweight metallic heat shield panel, made of Inconel and titanium, would lock together with others to form an armor layer on the vehicle. Such a metallic shield was deemed a viable alternative to ablative shields or ceramic tiles. However, NASA shelved this approach to thermal protection when it cancelled the X-33 project, and the Museum acquired a sample panel for its heat shield collection."

Troops that deployed in gliders tended to reach the ground in a more concentrated group than airborne troops that jumped from cargo airplanes wearing parachutes. Soldiers scattered across a wide area could not concentrate their firepower and were difficult or impossible to communicate with, and these limitations greatly reduced their combat effectiveness. Gliders could also carry light artillery or small vehicles directly into a landing zone to support paratroops (soldiers deployed by parachute) or glider-borne infantry. The primary U. S. Army combat glider was the Waco CG-4A. This glider could be difficult to handle with heavy loads and a skilled pilot was required to fly it.

The Hurricane was the first British monoplane fighter aircraft, and the first British fighter to exceed 483 kph (300 mph) in level flight. That it was designed and built at all was a major undertaking that literally flew in the face of conventional aeronautical wisdom in the mid-1930s.

During that same year, Camm designed a monoplane fighter and although it was not built, he realized that biplane fighters could not be designed to go faster than monoplanes. Two wings simply generated more drag than a single wing. It was time for a radical advance in fighter technology. In 1933, under Camm's direction, the Hawker design team began work on a new monoplane fighter and informal design proposals were made to the Air Ministry in August 1935. Camm and his team proposed a single-wing adaptation of the highly successful Hawker Fury biplane. They selected a liquid-cooled, 660 horsepower Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine to power the new aircraft. It was called the Fury Monoplane. Soon a new powerplant, forerunner of the legendary Rolls-Royce Merlin, was proposed for this airplane."

Hawker was expecting production orders so the company had already began to tool their production lines to build the airplane.

In December 1937, ten weeks after the first flight of a production Hurricane I on October 12, 1937, the first RAF squadron to convert to the new fighter, No. 111 at Northolt, traded in their Gloster Gauntlets biplanes for the new monoplanes.

The primary German fighter airplane, the Messerschmitt Bf109, outclassed the Hawker fighter in speed and armament; the difference was small enough that many times the outcome depended upon individual pilot skills. The Hurricane did enjoy several advantages over the Bf 109. It could out-turn the German fighter at all operational altitudes, it could sustain more damage and return to base, and when battle damage was so severe that a crash-landing became unavoidable, the Hurricane usually fell on friendly territory.

Lehmann’s grandfather held a seat on the board of directors of Swissair Airlines and he encouraged his grandson to become interested in aviation at an early age. Lehmann did become fascinated with airplanes but his less-than-perfect eyesight prevented him from flying military or commercial aircraft. When he was 24, Lehmann saw his first hang glider while watching the IMAX film To Fly! at the National Air and Space Museum in 1977. He learned hang gliding while living in Germany and continued to fly after he relocated to the U. S. in 1979. His passion for the sport led him to serve on the board of directors of the U. S. Hang Gliding Association. He competed in the 1998 World Hang Gliding Championships, and then became interested in setting records."

This goal flight, which he had to declare before taking off, exceeded the previous record goal flight by 16.1 km (10 miles). Lehmann took off from Zapata County Airport at 10:20 am but rather than setting a course directly downwind toward Big Lake, Lehmann had to first fly a curving course to the east to clear the civilian Class D airspace at Laredo, Texas. Lehmann finally felt confident he would reach Big Lake with 72.5 kilometers (45 miles) to go. Nine hours after taking off, he landed at Reagan County Airport at 7:00 pm. His maximum altitude during the flight was 2,736 m (9,000 feet) and highest ground speed 156 km/h (97 mph)."

Operational U-2As flew routinely from bases in Pakistan and Turkey to Norway, overflying vast stretches of the Soviet Union.

For four years the CIA operated these flights with U-2As and improved U-2Bs until May 1,1960, when Francis Gary Powers was shot down by a Soviet SA-2 missile over Sverdlovsk (now Ekaterinburg), thus sparking an embarrassing diplomatic incident for the United States and halting these flights."

Although fighter aircraft frequently gain greater attention, the most influential role of aviation in the First World War was reconnaissance. The extensive deployment of the Caudron G.4 in this role makes it an especially important early military aircraft. Moreover, despite its speed and armament limitations, the Caudron G.4 was quite reliable, had a good rate of climb, and was pleasant to fly, all characteristics that made it a good training aircraft after its combat effectiveness was reduced. Many Allied pilots received their initial flight training on the Caudron G.4.

The first factory-produced Caudron was the type A4, a 35-horsepower Anzani-powered tractor biplane in which the pilot sat completely exposed behind the rear spar of the lower wing. The next major Caudron design, the type B, was the first to feature the abbreviated fuselage/pilot nacelle, characteristic of many later Caudron aircraft. It was powered by a 70-horsepower Gnôme or 60-horsepower Anzani engine mounted in the front of the nacelle with the pilot immediately behind. Although a tractor, the tail unit of the type B was supported by booms extending from the trailing edge of the wings, an arrangement more commonly featured on pusher aircraft.

Initially designed as a trainer, the type G was developed into the G.2 by the outbreak of the First World War, and saw limited military service in 1914 as single and two-seat versions. By that time the Caudron factory had been relocated to Lyon, where an improved version, designated the G.3, was being produced in significant numbers. Soon a second factory was opened at Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, to meet military demand for the airplane. The G.3 was primarily a two-seat aircraft, but a few were converted to single-seat versions. They were powered variously by 80-horsepower Le Rhône or Gnôme rotary engines or a 90-horsepower Anzani radial. A total of 2,450 G.3s were built, including a small number built under license in Britain and Italy."

The Anzani-powered Caudron G.4s served mostly as training aircraft. Some of the Anzani-powered G.4s, but not all, had their engines set up to turn in opposite directions to balance the torque of the whirling propellers. All the Le Rhône-powered Caudrons had both engines rotating in the same direction, clockwise from the pilot's orientation. Also, the two vertical tail surfaces of the G.3 were increased to four on the G.4. The twin-engined configuration increased the range of the Caudron and provided a location for a forward-firing machine gun, typically a Hotchkiss or Lewis, although other types were also used. To protect against attacks from behind, some G.4s were fitted with an additional gun mounted on the top of the upper wing and pointed rearward, but this proved to be ineffective and it was frequently removed from operational aircraft. A number of G.4s had a second gun mounted immediately in front of the pilot on the deck of the nacelle (such as on the NASM Caudron). But more often the pilot and observer simply carried hand-held weapons to respond to attacks from the rear. Some G.4s carried a camera for high-altitude reconnaissance."

Extensively used as a bomber during the first half of 1916, its deployment in that role was severely reduced by the fall of that year. The Caudron's relative slow speed and inability to defend itself from the rear made it increasingly vulnerable to fighter attack as German air defense improved. But Caudrons continued to be widely used as reconnaissance aircraft well into 1917. By early 1918 virtually all Caudron aircraft still in use were relegated to training duties. In addition to the French, Caudrons were used extensively by British and Italian units, and a few were used by the Russians and the Belgians. Ten Caudron G.4s were sold to the United States in November 1917 and transferred to the U.S. Air Service's 2nd Air Instruction Center at Tours. Used exclusively as trainers, none of these Caudrons saw operational service with American units."

Yet it has great significance as an early light bomber and reconnaissance aircraft. It was a principal type used when these critical air power missions were being conceived and pioneered in World War I. Although fighter aircraft frequently gain greater attention, the most influential role of aviation in the First World War was reconnaissance. The extensive deployment of the Caudron in this role make it an especially important early military aircraft. Moreover, despite its speed and armament limitations, the Caudron was quite reliable, had a good rate of climb, and was pleasant to fly, all characteristics that made it a good training aircraft after its combat effectiveness was reduced. Many Allied pilots received their initial flight training on the Caudron. For all these reasons the Caudron occupies an important place in aviation history and in the National Air and Space Museum's aircraft collection. As an individual museum specimen, the NASM Caudron G.4 also has great significance. It is among the oldest surviving bomber aircraft in the world. Further, it is the only very early multi-engine airplane in the NASM collection, and one of the very few multi-engine aircraft from this period anywhere."

Its acceptance flight was made at Issy-les-Moulineaux on December 27, 1916. The pilot's name was Gerviès and it was reported that the airplane climbed to 1000 m (3,281 ft) in 7 minutes. The airplane had full radio and photographic equipment, characterized by the A2 reconnaissance variant. Caudron G.4 serial # C4263 saw no operational activity with the French Air Service. It was apparently sent to the Reserve Générale of the Aviation Militaire and remained there until it was purchased by the United States government in early 1917 through the American Ambassador, Mr. Sharp. The Caudron was acquired, along with a Voisin Type 8 (also in the NASM collection) and a Farman aircraft, for technical evaluation by the United States. However, by the time the aircraft were transported to the U.S. and prepared for flight demonstrations, they were already outmoded. This airplane was not among the ten purchased late in 1917 and deployed as trainers. Photographic evidence demonstrates that the NASM Caudron had arrived in the U.S. and was at Langley Field, Hampton, Virginia, at least by July 26, 1917, four months before the contract for the ten training aircraft was executed."

In 1929, Paul Garber, of the Smithsonian curatorial staff, acquired engines and propellers from the War Department, and had them installed on the Caudron. Unfortunately, Garber was unable to obtain the proper 80-horsepower Le Rhône rotary engines. Only 110-horsepower Le Rhônes were available, and Garber considered these to be at least representative of the correct powerplants. Similarly, the propellers acquired and installed on the airplane were only representative of the period and not the precise type that were actually used on the Caudron. Internal parts of the 110-horsepower Le Rhônes, such as pistons, connecting rods, etc., were removed from the engines to lighten them and put in storage. Smithsonian officials took this action as a safety measure because the airplane was suspended over a public area. The Caudron was displayed in this manner until the late 1960s or early 1970s, when it was removed from the Arts and Industries building and placed in storage at the Garber Facility. It received preservation treatment in 2000.

The armor consisted of a heavy metal plate inserted behind the seat of the rear cockpit, protruding upward so as to cover the back and head of the pilot. The armor plate is missing on the NASM Caudron. However, there is a gap, or slot, in the structure immediately behind the seat where such a plate would fit. Photographs of other Caudrons with the armor plate inserted show it in the same location as the slot behind the rear seat on the NASM Caudron.

It was planned that the X15 would be air-launched from a Boeing B-52 near Wendover. then fly down this corridor, the High Range. to Edwards. monitored by tracking stations at Ely and Beatty.

They reasoned that if a wing generates lift when presented to an oncoming flow of air, producing differing amounts of lift on either end of the wing would cause one side to rise more than the other, which in turn would bank the entire aircraft. A mechanical means of inducing this differential lift would provide the pilot with effective lateral control of the airplane. The Wrights accomplished this by twisting, or warping, the tips of the wings in opposite directions via a series of lines attached to the outer edges of the wings that were manipulated by the pilot. The idea advanced aeronautical experimentation significantly because it provided an effective method of controlling an airplane in three-dimensional space and, because it was aerodynamically based, it did not limit the size of the aircraft as shifting body weight obviously did. The satisfactory performance of the 1899 kite demonstrated the practicality of the wing warping control system."

For control of climb and descent, the gliders had forward-mounted horizontal stabilizers. Neither craft had a tail. The Wrights' home of Dayton, Ohio, did not offer suitable conditions for flying the gliders. An inquiry with the U.S. Weather Bureau identified Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, with its sandy, wide-open spaces and strong, steady winds as an optimal test site.

They built a small wind tunnel in the fall of 1901 to gather a body of accurate aerodynamic data with which to design their next glider. The heart of the Wright wind tunnel was the ingeniously designed pair of test instruments that were mounted inside.

While the engine was a significant enough achievement, the genuinely innovative feature of the propulsion system was the propellers. The brothers conceived the propellers as rotary wings, producing a horizontal thrust force aerodynamically. By turning an airfoil section on its side and spinning it to create an air flow over the surface, the Wrights reasoned that a horizontal \"lift\" force would be generated that would propel the airplane forward. The concept was one of the most original and creative aspects of the Wrights' aeronautical work.

It was completely disassembled, the parts thoroughly cleaned and preserved, and all new fabric covering applied. A careful search was made to locate new fabric that matched the original as closely as possible. When the fabric was replaced in 1927, it was sewn on in a slightly different way than originally done by the brothers in 1903. When stitching the new fabric in 1985, a large section of original flown 1903 wing covering was available and used as a pattern, ensuring the accuracy of the 1985 restoration."

Relatively minor changes in cockpit layout, engine accessories, and airframe construction led to the M-3 mailplane, which differed little in physical appearance from the M-2 version. A subsequent addition of five feet to the wingspan resulted in the final version, the M-4, which realized considerable gain in payload at a negligible loss in performance. While Western eventually added two M-4s to its fleet of six M-2s, the M-4 saw more extensive service with National Air Transport (later United Air Lines) from 1927 to 1930 on the Chicago-New York route.

Carrier planes could not hope to carry the same bomb load as shore-based aircraft, so they needed to be able to deliver each bomb as accurately as possible. Dive bombing was the answer. The technique gained official status in 1926 when the Navy included it in the fleet exercises. Accidents involving the bomb hitting the propeller or wheels on release, however, nearly ended its use. A solution was found in a bomb fork, which swung the bomb clear of the propeller arc. Approval followed in 1931."

At the same time, 18 Navy SBD-2s, launched from the Enterprise, which was returning to Hawaii from Wake Island, arrived just as the Japanese were attacking. Seven Dauntlesses were shot down or crash-landed. Two Japanese aircraft were claimed shot down by the Dauntlesses. Three days later the SBD gained the distinction of destroying the first Japanese warship of World War II when Lt Dickinson of VS-6 sank the Imperial Japanese submarine I-70 off of Hawaii."

The first action took the form of hit-and-run raids by the carriers Enterprise, Lexington, and Yorktown, against remote Japanese positions in the spring of 1942. While these raids caused little damage, they served notice that the U. S. Navy was still fighting. Dauntlesses were heavily involved and attacked many ships and shore installations in these raids. One of the most famous strikes of this period was the Doolittle raid on Tokyo. An SBD reported a Japanese picket boat ahead of the task force. The Dauntless crew also reported that the boat had probably sighted them, thus precipitating the early launch of Doolittle's B-25 bombers."

The SBD-3 brought the Dauntless up to full combat standards. Self-sealing wing tanks, crew armor, and an armored windscreen were all introduced. Experience gained in the Battle of the Coral Sea prompted the introduction of twin .30 caliber machine guns in the rear cockpit, thus increasing firepower. They were made standard in mid-production and earlier examples of the SBD-3 were retrofitted with the guns in the field. The added weight of these improvements was offset to a certain extent by the use of alclad to replace the dural skin of the earlier models, and the removal of the flotation equipment that was standard on the SBD-2. Maximum speed fell by a small margin to 250 mph, earning this model the tongue-in-cheek nickname of \" The Speedy Three\". Service ceiling, however, improved from 26,000 to 27,100 ft."

In this, the world's first carrier duel in which the opposing ships never came within sight of each other, Dauntlesses were responsible for sinking the Japanese small carrier Shoho.

The plan was to gain a base from where they could threaten the Hawaiian Islands and thus draw the remaining U.S. carriers out to be destroyed in a major fleet engagement. The U.S. Navy had an advantage in that they had broken the Japanese code and knew the attack was coming. Also, the Japanese did not realize that Yorktown, which had been damaged (and believed sunk) at Coral Sea, had been hastily repaired and was able to join Enterprise and Hornet at Midway. The three U.S. carriers carried 112 Dauntlesses. Most were the latest model, but a few SBD-1s and -2s were also aboard. While the Japanese had a much larger fleet, the sides were more evenly matched in the crucial area of airpower. The Japanese had four aircraft carriers, and the U.S. had three carriers and the land-based aircraft at Midway, which included 19 SBD-2s."

Meanwhile, a PBY Catalina had spotted the Japanese fleet and the U.S. carriers began to launch their aircraft. Because of the varying launch times and speeds of the different aircraft, the TBD torpedo planes were the first to attack the Japanese carriers. The slow Devastators were easy targets for the Japanese fighters and were soon beaten back with no damage to the carriers. Because of the uncoordinated nature of the attack, the SBD squadrons had trouble finding the carriers. The Hornet SBD's never found the carriers. Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, the Commander of the Enterprise's Air Group, however, made a navigational guess that brought his VS-6 and VB-6 right over the Japanese carriers. The attacking TBDs had drawn down the Japanese fighter screen and the Dauntlesses found the targets wide open. Japanese indecision as to whether to launch further strikes on the island or to attack the recently discovered American carriers, left bombs and torpedoes, along with aviation fuel, scattered on the carriers' decks. At the same time as McClusky's group attacked, VB-3 from Yorktown arrived. The combined onslaught rained 39 bombs on three Japanese carriers in three to four minutes, and 11 direct hits mortally damaged the Akagi, Kaga and Soryu. The fourth carrier, Hiryu, was located later and was also sunk by Dauntlesses. Japan lost four carriers and many of its experienced aviators for the loss of 35 Dauntlesses from the six Navy and one Marine SBD squadrons engaged. The SBD had stopped the Japanese and allowed the U.S. to fight on an equal footing in the Pacific."

In contrast with the naval actions of the Pacific, SBD attacks were mostly against ground targets in support of the Allied landings. They were, however, called upon to attack seven Vichy French cruisers that set out to attack the Allied troopships.

But, at 245 mph maximum speed, this was also the slowest version. Early in 1943 the SBD-5, with a larger engine, started to enter squadron service. Two additions that increased bombing accuracy were the replacement of the telescopic sight of the early models with a reflector sight and a heated windscreen, which overcame the fogging that had been common in the dive run.

Its role on the new carriers changed however. The new CVs could carry 100 airplanes, compared to 80 on the older carriers, and the scout squadrons were eliminated. The difference in airplanes was made up by an increase in the numbers of fighters. Scout duties were now taken over by the Hellcats and Avengers, both of which had long range capabilities. From then on, Dauntlesses would serve almost exclusively as strike aircraft. SBDs continued to fly throughout 1943 and not until late in the year did the SB2C Helldiver finally enter service. Many navy pilots did not see the Helldiver as much of an improvement over the Dauntless. Pilots preferred the SBD's more responsive controls which made it an easy plane to fly when lightly loaded.

The Banshee was delivered as the A-24, A-24A, and A-24B, which were equivalent to the SBD-3, -4, and -5.
